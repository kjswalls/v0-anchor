    /**
     * THE BOARD-EXCLUSIVE TAIL.
     *
     * dnd.spec and habits.spec resolve drop targets by comparing rect CENTRES,
     * so they need an EMPTY board — not merely their own fixtures cleaned up.
     * Every other spec now sweeps a prefix it owns (`specScope` in
     * helpers/api.ts); these two cannot, because the problem is not whose rows
     * get deleted but whose rows EXIST while they measure. Another spec's
     * fixture moves their geometry without either file touching the other.
     *
     * So they are separated in TIME instead of by prefix. `dependencies` runs a
     * project only after its dependencies have fully finished, which is the one
     * ordering primitive that crosses file boundaries — `mode: 'serial'` is
     * file-scoped and `workers` is config-global, so neither can express "these
     * two files, never at the same time as anything else".
     *
     * The chain is total: chromium+mobile → dnd → habits. dnd depends on BOTH
     * front projects because mobile-tagged tests create fixtures too (pause,
     * eod-review, recurring), and habits depends on dnd because both
     * sweep the bare prefix and would otherwise delete each other — the exact
     * failure this whole arrangement exists to prevent, one level down.
     *
     * COST, AND THE ESCAPE HATCH. `dependencies` means "after that project
     * SUCCEEDS", not "after it finishes", so a single red test anywhere in
     * chromium skips this whole tail. Measured, not predicted: the first full
     * run under this config reported `23 did not run` — these 15 plus 8 serial
     * siblings — while 13 unrelated chromium tests were failing. A suite that
     * silently stops running its drag coverage whenever anything else is red is
     * worse than one that runs it noisily, so the tail is also reachable on its
     * own:
     *
     *     pnpm e2e:board
     *
     * which selects both projects with `--no-deps --workers=1`. Every word of
     * that is load-bearing. `--no-deps` is what makes the tail reachable while
     * chromium is red — it is the entire point. But it ALSO drops habits'
     * dependency on dnd, so the two would run in parallel and sweep the bare
     * prefix out from under each other; `--workers=1` is what puts them back in
     * sequence. Chaining two invocations with `&&` instead looks equivalent and
     * is not: a failure in dnd short-circuits habits, which is the same
     * "dependency failed, so it never ran" hole this script exists to escape,
     * one level down. (Observed, not reasoned about — the `&&` version was
     * written first and skipped habits on its first run.)
     *
     * The other cost is wall clock: the tail is serial, so a full run is longer
     * than a fully parallel one by roughly these two files' runtime. That is the
     * price of measuring an empty board at all.
