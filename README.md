**Do Stuff Unlimited** — a personal planning PWA. A day/week schedule grid, a
braindump sidebar, recurring habits, an end-of-day review, reminders that reach
out on their own, and an AI assistant ("Beacon").

Next.js App Router + Supabase, deployed on Vercel.

## Getting started

```bash
pnpm install
vercel env pull .env.local   # .env.local is gitignored and Vercel-generated
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

E2E tests need a separate `.env.test` — see `.env.test.example`.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm dev            # next dev --webpack
pnpm build          # next build --webpack
pnpm lint           # eslint .
pnpm test           # vitest run  (unit)
pnpm e2e            # playwright test
pnpm db:list        # supabase migration list
pnpm db:push        # supabase db push
pnpm db:new <name>  # supabase migration new
```

## Layout

pnpm workspace, Node 24.

| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `components/`       | The UI (`views/`, `shell/`, `planner/`, `sidebar/`, `mobile/`, …)  |

| `packages/types`    | `@dsul/types` — shared Zod schemas; its `dist/` is committed       |
| `openclaw-plugin/`  | `@dsul/openclaw-context` — brings your plan into an AI conversation |
| `supabase/`         | Migrations — the single source of truth for the schema             |
