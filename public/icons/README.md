# dsul PWA icons

The mark is the lucide `Zap` glyph in `--lime-ink` on a `--lime-solid` ground —
the same lockup as the login wordmark (`app/login/page.tsx`).

These are **maskable** (`purpose: "any maskable"` in `public/manifest.json`), so
the ground fills the whole square and the glyph sits inside the centre 80%; the
OS applies its own corner mask. Do not pre-round the corners.

Replacing them is a drop-in: keep the filenames and sizes.
