 * proposal.ts — validating and describing AI planner proposals.

 * A proposal is a diff the AI suggests and the user accepts with one tap
 * (memory/plans/ai-vision.md). The model producing it is not trusted: it can
 * name a type that does not exist, put a date on a type that is not
 * date-anchored, or invent a status from the wrong vocabulary. Everything it
 * proposes is checked against the type registry here, BEFORE the card is shown,
 * so the user is never offered a change that would fail or corrupt a row.
 *
 * Invalid operations are dropped rather than failing the whole proposal — one
 * hallucinated field should not throw away a good six-item plan.
