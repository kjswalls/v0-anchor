/**
 * The surfaces that can hold a notice in place.
 *
 * Deliberately a closed union rather than a string: an anchor is a promise that
 * some component mounts a slot for it (lib/notice-anchors.ts), and a typo in a
 * free-text anchor is a notice that silently never renders anywhere.
 *
 *  - `braindump`  — pinned under the braindump header, above the rows.
 *  - `day-header` — beside the date, in the canvas header row.
 *
 * `day-foot` (the foot of today's column) was built and removed before this
 * shipped, and the reason is worth keeping: lib/use-fit-hour-px.ts sizes the
 * schedule grid's hours to `viewport - anchorTop - BOTTOM_RESERVE` with
 * BOTTOM_RESERVE at 24px, and it counts only chrome ABOVE the grid — so a 34px
 * row below the grid inside the same scroller cannot be seen by it and makes a
 * compressed day scroll that previously fit. The header row has the opposite
 * property: its height is max(children), which the capsule already sets at 96,
 * so a line beside the date costs nothing at all. That is the same argument
 * ProgramNotice makes for the same address.

/**
 * The shape of a thing the app says first.
 *
 * Anchor has two directions of speech and they used to be scattered. The user
 * speaks to the app through one input at the bottom of the sidebar; the app
 * spoke back from a 50px strip in the canvas, a modal, a `text-xs` line two of
 * six layouts rendered, and a five-second toast. A notice is the app's half of
 * that conversation, given one shape so it can be given one home — the dock,
 * directly above the omnibar. See components/sidebar/dock-notices.tsx.
 *
 * The membership rule is narrow on purpose and it is about DECISIONS, not about
 * importance. A notice earns a line here only if there is something the user
 * has to answer. A permanent fact about the world ("Summer is off") is not a
 * notice — it belongs on the thing it is a fact about, which is why a scope's
 * pause state rides its own switch (its group header, and the Display menu's
 * Paused-scopes list) and the day's suppression line sits in the canvas header
 * beside the date. Put standing
 * facts in here and the dock silts up into a notification centre nobody reads,
 * which is the failure mode this surface exists to avoid.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED WITH DIRECTION E, and what did not. The membership rule above is
 * unchanged and still load-bearing. What moved is the ADDRESS: a notice that
 * has an object on screen now renders on that object (`anchor`, and
 * {@link placeNotices}), and the dock keeps at most one line — the highest-
 * ranked question with nowhere else to live. So the rule binds harder than
 * before, not less: nearly everything that is a standing fact about a thing is
 * now literally drawn on that thing. See memory/plans/notices-in-place.md.

   * surface is mounted; declining to name one is the judgement that this notice

   * That judgement is not a rule code can derive, so it is argued per notice in

 * completely, because a message surface that hides messages to protect its own

/**
 * Where each notice actually renders: the dock's one line, or its own object.
 *
 * E's tradeoff is that a notice you never scroll to is a notice you never see,
 * and E's own answer is that deciding which is which is a judgement per notice.
 * That judgement is the `anchor` field and it is argued in
 * memory/plans/notices-in-place.md. Two parts of it are NOT judgement, and this
 * function is where the code takes them back:
 *
 *  1. **`blocked` never renders in place.** A notice that says the app cannot
 *     proceed is the one thing that must never be off-screen, whatever anchor it
 *     grows later. This is the rule E's tradeoff is actually about, and it is the
 *     one rule a rule can be.
 *  2. **A notice with a tray never renders in place.** A tray is a body that
 *     opens upward out of the dock (a Popover) or as a Drawer; an in-place row
 *     draws no tray at all, so anchoring one would silently drop its contents.
 *     Placement must not be able to lose a notice's body.
 *
 * And one that is neither judgement nor policy but simple honesty: an anchor
 * whose slot is not mounted is not an anchor (lib/notice-anchors.ts). The caller
 * passes the live set; anything unplaceable falls back to the dock, so a notice
 * is never routed to a surface nobody is looking at.
 *
 * Pure, and it ranks its own output, so a caller cannot place notices in one
 * order and draw them in another.
