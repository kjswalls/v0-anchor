/**
 * Which drop targets each input type is offered — the one place that answers it.
 *
 * ## What this is for
 *
 * The droppable grammar in lib/dnd/CONTRACT.md was written for a cursor. One
 * entry in it is a target a finger cannot use:
 * `scheduled:{bucket}:{before|after}:{ref}` is an 8px sliver between two timed
 * rows (`h-2 -my-0.5`, `day-buckets.tsx`). Against WCAG 2.5.8's 24px minimum
 * target size that is a third of the floor, on the input with the coarsest
 * pointer.
 *
 * Mechanically it is a MOVE like every other drop — `inferDropTime` resolves it
 * as ±30 min from the reference row's own time — so it is not the
 * drag-to-reorder that `dnd-no-reorder.test.ts` forbids, and it survived that
 * sweep. Kirby's call: remove it for touch, and accept the cost — on a phone
 * there is no longer a way to say "put this just before that one"; you drop the
 * row in the bucket and set its time. Mouse and pen keep it exactly as it was.
 *
 * ## The finger gets the BUCKET in the same place, not nothing
 *
 * `spine:{bucket}:{above|below}:{itemId}` is the touch-only replacement, and it
 * is not a nicety — deleting the sliver outright is a silent wrong-bucket bug.
 * Collision is `closestCenter`, which compares CENTRES, not containment
 * (`tests/e2e/helpers/dnd.ts` says so). Withhold the slivers and the lowest
 * droppable centre a tall bucket card owns jumps up to the card's own middle, so
 * the lower band of that card starts resolving to the NEXT bucket: measured, a
 * drop just under the last timed row in Morning came back as `afternoon`. The
 * band opens once the dragged-over card is taller than the next card plus two
 * gaps — about four timed rows — and grows without bound after that.
 *
 * So the touch rule is a SUBSTITUTION, not a deletion. The same 8px boxes mount
 * for a finger carrying the spine id instead, which keeps every droppable centre
 * exactly where main put it — touch geometry is unchanged to the pixel — while
 * the COMMAND behind them changes from "schedule at that row's time ±30 min" to
 * "assign this bucket, no time", i.e. precisely the fallback Kirby named.
 * `tests/unit/dnd-touch-drop-geometry.test.tsx` pins the band shut.
 *
 * ## Why a table and not an `isTouch &&`
 *
 * Two rules, at two levels, and they answer different questions:
 *
 * - The **view-level rule** — what should this user be OFFERED? That is per
 *   view: it is about geometry and affordance, and only the view knows what it
 *   renders, which is why the substitution above can only happen there.
 * - The **grammar-level rule** — what does this id MEAN for this input? That is
 *   a total function over every id shape in CONTRACT.md and every view that will
 *   ever emit one, and it lives in `resolveDrop`.
 *
 * Neither is redundant and neither is a backstop for the other. What they share
 * is the answer, and that is what this file is: a `Record` keyed by the target
 * KIND, so the rule is stated once instead of at each site (the scattering the
 * registry convention in CLAUDE.md exists to prevent), and so a new kind of drop
 * target fails `tsc` until someone answers "can a thumb hit this?".
 *
 * ### D2 — the view-level rule is currently implemented at ONE mount site
 *
 * `TimedGapDropZone` in `day-buckets.tsx` is the only droppable that consults
 * this table before mounting. `EmptyBucketDropZone`, the week cells, the hour
 * slots, the project blocks and the braindump do not. That is harmless today,
 * because `relative-time` and `bucket-spine` are the only restricted kinds and
 * both live in that one component — but it means withholding some FUTURE kind
 * from an input would fire the grammar-level rule alone, and the drop would
 * become a silent no-op instead of resolving somewhere sensible. Restricting a
 * new kind means giving its mount site the same gate.
