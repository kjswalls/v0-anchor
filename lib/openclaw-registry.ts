/**
 * Where Anchor POSTs change events, and how it finds them.
 *
 * Registrations live in `plugin_registrations` (migration 042). They used to
 * live in an in-process Map, with a comment saying "in production this would
 * live in Supabase" — and production arrived. On Vercel that Map dies with the
 * instance and is absent on every other one, so a plugin that registered
 * against instance A never heard about a mutation served by instance B. The
 * plugin re-registering on startup did not save it: the very next cold start
 * lost it again.
 *
 * THREE THINGS ABOUT THE SHAPE:
 *
 * 1. The table is the truth; the Map below is a CACHE with a short TTL. This is
 *    called from `lib/db.ts` on every mutation, and a query per write to find
 *    the usually-zero rows would be a real cost for a rare payoff. Staleness is
 *    bounded by the TTL, which is strictly better than the old behaviour's
 *    "invisible to other instances forever".
 *
 * 2. It degrades to the old Map when the table is missing, so a build deployed
 *    ahead of `db:push` keeps registering rather than 500ing. Same
 *    `…Available` flag pattern `lib/db.ts` uses for `item_events`.
 *
 * 3. SERVER ONLY, and it has to say so at runtime: `notifyPlugins` is reached
 *    through `lib/db.ts`, which the BROWSER also imports. There is no service
 *    key there, so the client path is a deliberate no-op — exactly what the
 *    empty Map did before. The import is dynamic so the service client lands in
 *    a lazy chunk rather than the main one; it does NOT remove it from the
 *    client build, and nothing here depends on that — the key check is what
 *    makes the branch unreachable, and no secret is in the bundle either way.
 *
 * ONE HONEST COST. Every call site fires this unawaited and there is no
 * `waitUntil`, so on serverless a frozen invocation can cut the delivery short.
 * The read now sits in front of the `fetch`, which widens that window for a
 * WARM instance whose cache has just expired. It does not widen it for the case
 * this exists to fix: before, a cold instance had an empty Map and delivered
 * NOTHING, so cold-start delivery went from impossible to merely at risk.
 * Closing the rest means `after()` at the route level, which cannot live in
 * this module — `lib/db.ts` reaches it from the browser.
