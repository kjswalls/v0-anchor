/**
 * container-registry.ts — what each KIND of container is, and how its
 * references behave.
 *
 * The sibling of item-registry.ts, and the same bargain: every place the app
 * used to ask "is this a project or a habit group?" asks the registry a
 * capability question instead. Adding a kind means adding config.
 *
 * ── the three roles ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Anchor has four container tables and they are not four of a kind. One says
 * what an item IS ABOUT, two say WHEN IT COUNTS, and one says WHY IT MATTERS —
 * and that difference decides every question anyone asks about them:
 *
 *   CLASSIFY — projects. Exactly one per item, stored as a name on the item
 *     itself (`items.project`). One item, one answer, so it is a partition:
 *     filterable, groupable, and the thing a coloured dot names. This is the
 *     "container axis" the Display menu speaks about.
 *
 *     There were TWO classify kinds until migration 039 — `project` for tasks
 *     and `group` (habit group) for habits — which were the same shape wearing
 *     two names. Tasks and habits have been ONE entity since 019, with an
 *     open-text `type` discriminator, so a second classify kind was a
 *     distinction the data model no longer made: a custom type had to pick a
 *     side, and the Display menu had to draw one question as two lists. The
 *     ROLE is what says one-per-item; the noun is just a noun, and it lives in
 *     `CONTAINER_KINDS.project.label` so changing it later is a string edit
 *     rather than a migration. `habit_groups` and `items."group"` survive as
 *     frozen rollback ballast — nothing here reads them.
 *
 *   GATE — routines, programs. Many-to-many through join tables, and membership
 *     does not describe the work, it SWITCHES it — pausing a routine takes its
 *     members off the grid. An item can sit in three routines at once, so there
 *     is no "the" routine to file it under; `lib/grouping.ts` groups by routine
 *     only through a documented first-claim-wins rule, and the Display menu
 *     deliberately offers no routine FILTER because the scope rail already owns
 *     that question per-date, through the DB, with a resume date. That last
 *     argument is what a GOAL filter does not have to answer to: nothing else
 *     in the app narrows a view to one goal, and a goal has no resume date to
 *     own it with.
 *
 *   ASPIRE — goals. Many-to-many like a gate, but membership switches NOTHING:
 *     a goal says why work matters, and a goal you are behind on is the last
 *     thing that should quietly hide its work. Its members carry a ROLE
 *     (`member` | `milestone` | `checkin`, on goal_items), which is the one
 *     thing no other kind has — and the reason it is a role of its own rather
 *     than a gate with suppression turned off: an item can sit in a goal AND a
 *     program at once (the Chinese habit inside the school-year program), so
 *     the two questions have to be asked separately or the answers merge.
 *     Since the goal display work it IS a filter and a grouping axis — by id,
 *     never by ref, and never as suppression; see the seam below.
 *
 * The seam is enforced by types, not by convention: `ClassifyKind` is what a ref
 * can name and what `containerRefOf` returns; `GateKind` is what `ScopeKind` is
 * and what `ActivationContext` carries; `AspireKind` is neither, and nothing
 * downstream widens to it. So a routine cannot leak into a filter clause and a
 * project cannot gate a day. `ClassifyKind` being a single-member union is not
 * an invitation to delete it: it is what keeps `containerRef`, `foldRef` and
 * `containerRefOf` refusing a gate or a goal, and a second classify kind (if one
 * is ever justified again) rejoins by declaring its role.
 *
 * A GOAL is now visible to filters.ts and grouping.ts, and that is a narrowing
 * of the original claim, not an exception to the seam — the type unions are
 * untouched. What crosses is never an `AspireKind` and never a ref; the seam is
 * about the KIND, not about how much of a goal a view module may hold:
 *
 *   - `ViewFilters.goals` holds ids, and `lib/filters.ts` sees only those ids
 *     plus a `ReadonlySet` of item ids resolved from `goal_items` — it is
 *     store-free by contract, so it is handed the answer rather than the goals.
 *     `containerRef`/`containerKindOf` still answer only for CLASSIFY kinds, so
 *     a goal cannot enter `containers` and `containerRefOf` cannot return one.
 *     The two clauses never mix.
 *   - `lib/grouping.ts` takes whole `readonly Goal[]` records, exactly as it
 *     already takes `Routine[]` and `Program[]`: a section needs the name for
 *     its heading and the role arrays to claim its rows. That is more than an
 *     id and it is still inside the seam — nothing in a `Goal` resolves
 *     activation, and the kind never appears.
 *   - Grouping by goal is `lib/grouping.ts`'s first-claim-wins rule — the one
 *     the gates already needed, because a many-to-many is not a partition. A
 *     goal section carries no `gate`, so its heading has no switch: the gates'
 *     grouping can pause a container from a header and the aspire one cannot.
 *   - Nothing goal-shaped reaches `lib/active.ts`, `isItemActiveOn`,
 *     `inactiveItemIdsOn` or scope-rail.ts. A goal STILL cannot suppress an
 *     item — the filter narrows a view the user is looking at and clears with
 *     Reset display; suppression is DB state that outlives the session.
 *
 * The distinction the seam is really making, then: CLASSIFY is the axis an item
 * ANSWERS WITH, GATE is the axis that RESOLVES ACTIVATION, and ASPIRE may
 * organise a view while doing neither.
 *
 * A NOTE ON DISCOVERY, because the obvious assumption is wrong: widening
 * `ContainerKind` does NOT light up the codebase with exhaustive-switch errors.
 * There are no switches over it — every consumer narrows to `ClassifyKind` or
 * `GateKind` first, which is exactly the property above. The compiler forces
 * one edit (the `CONTAINER_KINDS` record) and the role-partition test in
 * tests/unit/container-registry.test.ts forces the rest of the thinking. A
 * sixth kind's real touchpoints are hand-wired and listed in its plan.
 *
 * ── what is deliberately NOT here ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `item_types` is the fifth table and stays out. A type is what a thing IS, not
 * what it belongs to; it already has its own registry, and folding it in here
 * would make "which container does this item answer with" ambiguous at the one
 * call site that has to be unambiguous (`containerRefOf`).
 *
 * CUSTOM container kinds are not v1. The four below are the four tables that
 * are read; `CONTAINER_KINDS` is a closed record, so a fifth is a type error at
 * the record itself rather than a silent fallthrough.
 *
 * The table names and the id columns are not here either. Migration 027
 * (`feat/organize-console`, organize-console.md Phase 0) gives items
 * `project_id`, and the resolution that goes with it lives with that work —
 * this module stays pure and store-free, so it has nothing to resolve a name
 * against. A config field no code reads is a field that drifts.
 *
 * 027 shipped TWO id columns, one per classify kind, so each could carry a real
 * foreign key with ON DELETE SET NULL — which one column pointing at either of
 * two tables cannot. 039 removed the second kind rather than the second column:
 * `items.group_id` stays as ballast beside `items."group"`, unread.
