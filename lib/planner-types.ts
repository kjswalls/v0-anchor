 * The starter set a brand-new account is given (organize-console decision 2).
 *
 * NO `id`, and the type says so. These are TEMPLATES: an id baked into a module
 * constant would be the same uuid in every account, which the `(user_id, id)`
 * composite key would tolerate and every other assumption in the app would not.
 * The seeding action mints one per row. (This is also why the constants had six
 * of the branch's tsc errors — they were typed as finished `Project` /
 * `HabitGroupType` values, which have required ids since 027.)
 *
 * `icon:PascalName` tokens, not bare emoji. The emoji here predate the token
 * system by a year and were never migrated, because nothing ever imported these
 * — they would have rendered as a literal "💼" in a row that draws Lucide glyphs
 * everywhere else.
 *
 * ONE LIST since migration 039, and the six names are the two old lists
 * unchanged. They were deliberately made disjoint when projects and habit groups
 * were separate namespaces (a chip reading "Work" could not say which it meant),
 * which is exactly what makes concatenating them safe now that there is only one
 * namespace — there is no pair to collide. The WHERE names (Work / Home /
 * Health) come first and the WHEN names (Morning / Movement / Wind-down) after,
 * because that is the order the console lists them in and habits are gardened by
 * time of day.
