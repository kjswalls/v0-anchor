/**
 * WHAT, IF ANYTHING, TO CREATE FOR AN ACCOUNT ON ITS FIRST CONSIDERED LOAD.
 *
 * Pure, and separate from the store on purpose: this decides whether to write
 * rows into an account automatically, which is the highest-consequence automatic
 * write in the app. Every branch is reachable from a plain function call, so the
 * blast radius is testable without standing up a store or a network.
 *
 * THREE OUTCOMES, and the middle one is the reason this is not a one-liner.
 *
 *   'none'        — the account already has containers. Touch nothing at all.
 *   'new-account' — no containers AND no items. The full starter set.
 *   'adopt'       — no containers but items exist. Create ONLY the containers
 *                   those items already name, and nothing else.
 *
 * The 'adopt' branch exists because the live data made the naive rule
 * indefensible. The main account carries 763 items, zero container rows, and 119
 * habits whose `group` text reads "Personal" with nothing behind it. "Sections
 * are empty, so seed" would have written Work, Home and Health into an account
 * that has visibly never used projects — inventing three containers to fix a
 * problem about one. Adopting says the only thing the data supports: these items
 * claim a container, so give them the container they claim.
 *
 * It also fixes something the text-only reference could not. Until a row exists,
 * "Personal" cannot be renamed, cannot be given a glyph, cannot be deleted, and
 * does not appear in the console at all — while 119 items sit inside it.
 *
 * AN ACCOUNT WITH SOME CONTAINERS IS LEFT ALONE ENTIRELY, including its dangling
 * names. One live account references a project "Housework" that has no row; the
 * account has four other projects, so its owner is clearly managing them by
 * hand, and a name they have not created in all that time is a name they do not
 * want. That is today's behaviour and 027's backfill made the same call.
 *
 * TRASHED NAMES ARE EXCLUDED, and this is a correctness guard rather than
 * politeness. `projects_user_id_name_key` is a PLAIN unique index over
 * `(user_id, name)` with no `WHERE deleted_at IS
 * NULL`, so a soft-deleted container reserves its name for the full 30 days
 * while being invisible to every `deleted_at`-filtered fetch the store makes.
 * Adopting a name the bin still holds would raise 23505 and seat exactly the
 * phantom container `undoFailedCreate` exists to clean up — from an automatic
 * write the user never asked for.

/**
 * The whole first-run pass, run after a load that RESOLVED CLEANLY.
 *
 * Lives here rather than in supabase-provider.tsx because the order of its four
 * steps is the design, and an ordering that only exists inside a provider
 * closure is an ordering no test can reach. The provider keeps the trigger; this
 * keeps the decision.
 *
 *   1. LATCH FIRST, so every load after the first costs one SELECT and stops.
 *      `fetchContainersSeeded` fails CLOSED — a read that did not work answers
 *      "already seeded" — because the failure on the other side is writing
 *      containers into an account whose state could not be read.
 *   2. RE-CHECK THE STORE. The latch read is an await, and Supabase re-emits
 *      SIGNED_IN on every hidden→visible transition, so the store can have been
 *      replaced underneath by then.
 *   3. READ THE BIN. The container name indexes have no
 *      `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`, so a soft-deleted row holds its name for
 *      thirty days while being invisible to the store; creating it anyway is
 *      23505 and a phantom container, out of a write nobody asked for.
 *   4. LATCH ON THE OUTCOME, not before it. See below — this is the half the
 *      first version got backwards.
 *
 * An account that HAS containers is latched too. It needs nothing, but it has
 * now been considered, and leaving it unlatched would spend a SELECT on every
 * load forever asking a question whose answer cannot change.
 *
 * THE COMMIT REPORTS BACK, AND `userId` TRAVELS WITH THE PLAN. Both of those are
 * corrections to a first version that reasoned about the awaits and then wrote
 * the checks where they could not cover them:
 *
 *   - The account-switch check ran BEFORE two more awaits (the bin read and the
 *     latch write) and nothing re-checked afterwards, so a bare SIGNED_IN for a
 *     different user — which the provider handles in two other places precisely
 *     because Supabase delivers them — carried one account's plan into another
 *     account's store. Passing `userId` into `commit` lets the writer refuse.
 *   - `commit` returned void, so every guard inside it was a silent refusal this
 *     function could not see, and the latch had already been spent. The account
 *     ended latched with zero containers and NO PATH THAT COULD EVER RETRY;
 *     recovery was a hand-written UPDATE. Latching only on a real outcome makes
 *     a refusal cost one wasted load instead of the feature.
 *
 * That inverts the original ordering argument, and the inversion is safe because
 * the durable idempotence guard was never the latch: it is `projects.length > 0`
 * READ BACK FROM THE DATABASE. If the containers landed and the latch write did
 * not, the next load fetches them and takes the 'none' branch — self-healing.
 * The latch's real job is narrower and still intact: remembering that an account
 * which DELETED its starter set must not be given another one.
