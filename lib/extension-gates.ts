/**
 * extension-gates.ts — one place to ask "is this idea switched on", and one
 * place that says what "off" MEANS.
 *
 * lib/extension-registry.ts declares that an extension EXISTS. This module is
 * how a surface asks about one, and it exists for the same reason
 * lib/item-registry.ts does: a component that writes
 * `resolveEnabled(s.enabled, 'goals')` has inlined a slug and a policy, and the
 * next component writes a subtly different one. Every gate below is a
 * capability question with its answer stated once.
 *
 * ── OFF MEANS INERT, NOT HIDDEN ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Kirby, 2026-08-26: "I think off means inert, but still findable. Like an
 * extension store." So a switched-off extension keeps everything that lets you
 * FIND it — its catalog row in lib/extension-registry.ts, the settings pane
 * generated from that row, its search hits, and (for the palette) its command,
 * greyed rather than deleted. What stops is the BEHAVIOUR. Concretely:
 *
 *   Goals off
 *     · the Goal FILTER clause narrows nothing — `useGoalFilterIds` returns
 *       `null`, which lib/filters.ts already reads as inert. A stranded
 *       selection therefore hides no row; it is simply not consulted.
 *     · the Goal GROUPING value falls back to 'none' — `useCanvasGroupBy` /
 *       `useBraindumpGroupBy`. NOT to an empty goals list, which would mint one
 *       giant "No goal" section over every row and look like a bug.
 *     · goal MEMBERSHIP stops reaching the canvas: no role glyph, no Goal
 *       section in the item dialog, no goal line in Beacon's context.
 *     · /goal/[id] stops being a live surface and says so.
 *     · NO ITEM DISAPPEARS. That is the whole reason goals are an `aspire`
 *       kind (lib/container-registry.ts): a goal suppresses nothing when it is
 *       on, so switching it off must not suppress anything either. Every gate
 *       here removes a LAYER OVER items, never an item.
 *     · nothing is written. `goals` and `goal_items` are untouched, so
 *       switching back on restores every goal, every role and every membership.
 *     · EIGHT READS ARE DELIBERATELY NOT GATED, across six files, and they are
 *       all the same read: `milestoneItemIds`. It is the set every bulk date
 *       verb SUBTRACTS, because a milestone's `startDate` is not stale
 *       scheduling residue — it is the TARGET date, and rewriting it is not
 *       undone by switching the extension back on. The date it replaced is
 *       gone. Gating any of these would make "off" destructive, which is the
 *       one thing off must never be: a gate that protects data stays on.
 *
 *         lib/planner-store.ts:2387  moveTasksToDate      ← the enforcement
 *         lib/planner-store.ts:2444  unscheduleTasks      ← the enforcement
 *         lib/planner-store.ts:2821  scheduleItemsAt      ← the enforcement
 *         components/shell/app-shell.tsx:316    multi-drop `acted` accounting
 *         components/shell/bulk-action-bar.tsx:148  the bar's own affordances
 *         hooks/use-overdue-sweep.ts:336            the auto-age sweep
 *         components/ai/eod-review.tsx:115          the EOD move-all
 *         components/ai/morning-triage-list.tsx:236 the morning triage
 *
 *       The three STORE ones are the actual enforcement — the last line before
 *       the write — and the five UI ones exist so a surface does not report
 *       success over a write the store then refuses. Pinned in
 *       tests/unit/extension-gates-goals.test.tsx ("a bulk date verb still
 *       refuses a milestone with Goals off"), because gating them leaves the
 *       whole suite green.
 *
 *   Organize off
 *     · the console does not open, and every door to it (the braindump button,
 *       the user card's Trash row, the palette's three Organize commands) is
 *       inert rather than absent.
 *     · nothing is written, and no container is deleted or hidden. Projects,
 *       routines, programs, habit groups and item types all keep working
 *       everywhere else — what goes away is the BULK MANAGEMENT surface.
 *     · TRASH IS NOT PART OF IT. `extension: null` in console-rail.tsx keeps
 *       the Trash section alive whatever the toggles say, so the console still
 *       opens holding that one row. Deleting is not gated; gating only the
 *       recovery half would let the app's DEFAULT configuration destroy work
 *       with no cross-session way back. See the note on CONSOLE_SECTIONS.
 *
 *   THE API IS NOT GATED, ON EITHER OF THEM. /api/agent/goals,
 *   /api/agent/goals/[id] and the goals in /api/agent/context still read and
 *   WRITE for an account with Goals switched off. That is deliberate rather
 *   than missed: the agent surface is a frozen external contract that the
 *   OpenClaw plugin `safeParse`s and throws on (CLAUDE.md, "Legacy projections
 *   are permanent"), so a per-account toggle must not be able to change its
 *   shape mid-session. These gates are BROWSER-ONLY, and the asymmetry is the
 *   design: what stops is what Anchor shows you, not what your own agent may do
 *   with your own data.
 *
 * ── THE ONE PLACE THE TWO MEET ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Goals are CREATED in the console's Goals section, so gating the console with
 * Goals still on would leave an extension you can switch on and then not use.
 * `consoleSectionsFor` resolves that: the Goals section rides EXT_GOALS and
 * every other section rides EXT_ORGANIZE, so each of the four combinations is
 * coherent and the console opens whenever it has at least one section to show.
 *
 * ── A GATE MUST NEVER THROW ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * CLAUDE.md's rule for channels and stake adapters ("they must return a
 * failure, never throw it — an expired token in one must not cost the others")
 * applies harder here, because these gates run inside the canvas render. A gate
 * that threw would take the surface it was protecting down with it, which is
 * strictly worse than the feature it was gating. So every read is wrapped and
 * falls back to the manifest default.
 */

/**
 * Never let a store read take down the surface asking the question.
 *
 * The catch arm falls back to the MANIFEST DEFAULT rather than to a hard-coded
 * `false`, and `streaks` is the entry that makes the distinction load-bearing:
 * it ships `defaultEnabled: true`, so a thrown read that fell back to `false`
 * would quietly hide the flame from an account that never turned streaks off,
 * instead of leaving it where a fresh account sits. `extensionManifest` is a
 * plain array find over a module constant, so it cannot itself be the thing that
 * threw; the double guard is for the pathological case where it is.
