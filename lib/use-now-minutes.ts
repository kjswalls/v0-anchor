/**
 * The wall clock, in minutes since midnight, in the user's timezone — or `null`
 * on the server and during hydration.
 *
 * Null-first is not a nicety: reading the clock during render would produce a
 * different number on the server than in the browser, so the now-marker that
 * consumes this would hydrate mismatched. useSyncExternalStore gives that for
 * free — it serves the server snapshot through hydration, then swaps to the live
 * one — and, unlike an effect that seeds state, without a cascading render.
 * Everything downstream treats `null` as "no marker", which is also the right
 * state on a day that isn't today.
 *
 * The subscription re-renders once a minute, aligned to the minute BOUNDARY
 * rather than on a free-running 60s interval, so the marker moves when the clock
 * does instead of drifting up to a minute behind it. One pixel per minute is
 * also the finest thing the grid can show, so there's nothing to gain from
 * ticking faster.
