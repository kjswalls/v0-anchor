/**
 * ai-openers.ts — what Beacon offers instead of an empty box.
 *
 * A blank input is the single most expensive thing this app can put in front of
 * its audience: it demands initiation, which is exactly the executive function
 * the product exists to lend. memory/plans/ai-vision.md calls chat "a hostile
 * primary interface" for that reason and keeps it as an escape hatch — but an
 * escape hatch you cannot start using is not one. So the empty state offers
 * three concrete things to say.
 *
 * They are derived from the planner, not a static list, because a generic
 * suggestion is only marginally better than no suggestion: "What can I let go
 * of?" is a real offer on a day with things sitting past due and noise on a day
 * without any.
 *
 * Pure and store-free, like everything it composes — the caller passes the day
 * and the suppressed ids, the same way lib/proposal.ts and lib/day-items.ts
 * take them.
 *
 * COPY CONTRACT (shared with proposal-card.tsx, morning-check.tsx's `BarCopy`
 * and the "Still waiting" heading in item-registry.ts): no opener may name a
 * failure, count a miss, or imply lateness. "What can I let go of?" is the
 * shape to keep — permission, phrased in the user's own voice, because they are
 * the one about to say it.
