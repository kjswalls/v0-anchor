/**
 * Grouping — one partition function every surface calls.
 *
 * It used to be `buildListGroups` inside components/views/day-list.tsx, which is
 * why Day × List honoured all five values while Day × Buckets tested
 * `=== 'project'` and nothing else, and the other four surfaces honoured none:
 * the code that could answer the question lived inside the one view that asked
 * it. Everything here is pure — rows in, sections out — so the surfaces differ
 * only in WHICH rows they hand it.
 *
 * Two rules the callers must keep:
 *
 * 1. **Group first, then sort within each group.** These groups come back
 *    unsorted, in the row order they were given. `sortRows` is applied per group
 *    by the caller, never to the flat list beforehand — the maps below are
 *    filled by walking the rows, so sorting first reorders the SECTIONS. The
 *    braindump shipped that way for one commit; see the plan's gotcha list.
 * 2. **Never partition a spine that carries positional drop targets.** Day ×
 *    Buckets hands over its untimed rows only, because `inferDropTime` resolves
 *    "the gap above row X" as ±30 min from X's own time (lib/dnd/CONTRACT.md).
 *    Every other surface either has no per-row droppable or is not time-ordered
 *    to begin with, and hands over everything.

/**
 * The container section for one row, resolved through the registry.
 *
 * This is the half of the habits fix that grouping never got. `buildListGroups`
 * hoisted every habit into a single "Habits" section and grouped only the tasks,
 * so grouping by Project answered a question about tasks and then filed the rest
 * of the day under its own type name. A habit is not container-less — it answers
 * on the same axis, exactly as `passesContainerFilter` has since Phase 1, and
 * since migration 039 with the same field.
 *
 * The key is the PREFIXED ref. It used to be prefixed because a project and a
 * habit group could share a name and had to stay two sections (DEFAULT_PROJECTS
 * and DEFAULT_HABIT_GROUPS both seeded Work); 039 removed the collision at the
 * source. The prefix stays because these keys share a keyspace with the other
 * section keys — `priority:high`, `routine:none`, `goal:none`, `none:project` —
 * and `containerKindOf` is what tells a container ref apart from all of them.
 *
 * The key is FOLDED through `foldRef`, which is where the case policy lives.
 * It is not a preference: `makeAddDraft` writes a lowercase 'personal' against a
 * seeded capitalised 'Personal' whenever the container list has not loaded yet,
 * so both spellings live in real data. Grouping keyed on the raw ref would put
 * them in two sections that the menu's SINGLE "Personal" checkbox selects
 * together. The label is the first spelling seen, which is the store's own order.
 *
 * Unset is kind-TAGGED — `none:project` — rather than sharing the filter's bare
 * `NO_CONTAINER` sentinel. With one kind the two differ only in the suffix; the
 * tag stays because it is what keeps a heading key from ever reading as a real
 * ref, and because a second classify kind would need it back.
