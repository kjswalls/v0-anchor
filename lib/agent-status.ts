 * elapsed part is the whole reason this exists: "working" is not information,
 * "working for three hours" is. An agent four minutes into a task is fine; the
 * same agent three hours in has died somewhere and nobody would otherwise know
 * until they opened the item.
 *
 * COPY CONTRACT (shared with proposal-card.tsx, ai-openers.ts, morning-check's
 * `BarCopy`): nothing here names a failure of the USER's. `blocked` is the one
 * state that wants something from them, and it says so as a request — "needs
 * you" — not as a reprimand for not having noticed.
