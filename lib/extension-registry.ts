/**
 * The official extensions catalog — Anchor's declarative "plugin" surface.
 *
 * An extension is optional, first-party, extended functionality a user toggles
 * per-account in Settings → Extensions. This registry is the manifest list the
 * plan doc (memory/plans/plugins-themes-store.md, Project B) calls for: adding
 * an extension means adding config here, a gate at its surface, and nothing
 * else. No third-party code executes — "extensions" are declarative by locked
 * decision; the sandboxed-runtime tier is deliberately unbuilt.
 *
 * Enabled state lives in the user_extensions table (migration 026) as sparse
 * per-user rows; a slug with no row falls back to defaultEnabled here. Slugs
 * are permanent identifiers (they are the DB rows and the settings deep links)
 * — rename the label, never the slug.

 * Ideas, not peripherals (Tier 0) — the first two entries that gate what Anchor
 * MEANS rather than what it TOUCHES.
 *
 * Everything else in this catalog is a peripheral: a heatmap, a burst of
 * confetti, six ways to reach out of the app. "The Weight of Anchor" found the
 * registry was gating only those, so a brand-new account arrived holding the
 * entire conceptual model — goals, programs, routines, two rituals and a
 * twelve-section console — on day one. These two are the first half of the
 * answer, and they are the two the audit named as safest to cut first: goals
 * were built as a role that deliberately reaches nothing downstream, and the
 * console is one self-contained surface.
 *
 * OFF is INERT, NOT HIDDEN, and that is the whole design (Kirby, 2026-08-26):
 * "off means inert, but still findable. Like an extension store." A switched-off
 * extension keeps its catalog row, its settings pane and its search hits — every
 * one of these slugs is in OFFICIAL_EXTENSIONS below, which is what generates
 * all three. Only the BEHAVIOUR stops. What that means per surface is stated at
 * each gate and gathered in lib/extension-gates.ts.
 *
 * They split on the default now. GOALS still defaults off, for the reason the
 * channels do not share: a concept you have not met is weight you carry for
 * nothing. ORGANIZE defaults ON as of 2026-08-28 — the console was reworked to
 * be approachable rather than a wall of sections, so it stopped being weight and
 * started being the obvious home for the structure a user already has. Each
 * entry's `defaultEnabled` note carries the specifics, and — because the
 * fallback is evaluated per read — flipping Organize on reaches every account
 * with no saved row for it, existing and new, no migration.

 * Streaks (default ON) — the one entry that ships enabled, and the reason the

 * default apart from a hard `false`.
 *
 * It defaults ON because it is not a new idea a fresh account has to grow into;
 * it is a core habit mechanic that has always been visible, and defaulting it
 * off would silently strip the flame from every account that already reads one.
 * So this toggle ADDS an off switch rather than gating a feature in: turn it off
 * and every flame, streak count and reset control disappears, while the counter
 * itself keeps moving — reminders and stakes read `counters.streak`, not this,
 * so a streak-at-risk call still rings and a Beeminder datapoint still posts.
 * What stops is only what Anchor SHOWS you — the same browser-only asymmetry the
 * goals gates make (see lib/extension-gates.ts).
