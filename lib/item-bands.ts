/**
 * item-bands.ts — the item surface's layout, asked as a registry question.
 *
 * The chips on the edit panel and on /item/[id] used to render as ONE flat
 * wrapping row in source order: Priority beside Project beside Routine beside
 * Goal beside Date, five identical pills answering five unrelated questions.
 * Every chip already asked lib/item-registry.ts whether it may exist — the
 * house rule — but nothing asked about order, grouping or emphasis, so the
 * three container ROLES that lib/container-registry.ts spends four screens
 * distinguishing (classify · gate · aspire) reached the user as no distinction
 * at all.
 *
 * A BAND is one labelled row of that surface: a noun on the left, its controls
 * on the right. This module decides which container bands exist and in what
 * order, and it is the only place that answers. It is deliberately pure — no
 * React, no store — so the ordering and the gating are unit-testable without
 * standing up a panel.
 *
 * ── two decisions, and they are not the same decision ────────────────────────
 *
 * **The label is the KIND's noun, not the ROLE's verb.** An earlier draft
 * labelled the bands by role — "filed" (classify), "gated by" (gate), "serves"
 * (aspire). Kirby refused it: *"Let's just use nouns like 'program' and 'goal'"*.
 * The verbs are true and they are also vocabulary the user never asked for; a
 * noun they already know does the same work. So a band's label is
 * `CONTAINER_KINDS[kind].label` and nothing else — CLAUDE.md's rule that the
 * user-facing noun lives ONLY there is what makes a future rename a string edit,
 * and a literal 'Project' in a component is what would break it.
 *
 * **The role still decides everything else.** It orders the bands (what the item
 * IS ABOUT, then what SWITCHES IT OFF, then what it is FOR) and it decides when
 * a band renders at all — see `visibleContainerBands`, whose policy is written
 * per-role, never per-kind. That is the registry's own seam kept intact: the
 * kind supplies the word, the role supplies the behaviour.
 *
 * ── one band per KIND, so the two gates are two rows ─────────────────────────
 *
 * `gate` covers BOTH `routine` and `program`, so a role-driven layout would draw
 * them as one band. They stay two, for three reasons that survive the naming
 * change:
 *
 *   1. Labelling by kind leaves a merged gate band with no name the registry can
 *      supply. It would have to invent one ("Gates", "Timing") — a literal noun
 *      in a component, which is the exact thing the rule above forbids.
 *   2. They are different questions, and item-dialog.tsx already says so where
 *      the two chips are declared: "which routine is this part of" vs "which
 *      stretch of life does this belong to", and a merged picker "would have to
 *      invent a grouping the user never asked for".
 *   3. They are separate stores, separate join tables and separate write paths.
 *      One row holding two independent multi-selects is a control that has to
 *      explain itself; two rows explain themselves.
 *
 * A fifth kind joins by declaring its role, and lands in the right place in the
 * right order with no edit here.
 */

/**
 * Reading order for the bands: what the item is ABOUT, what can switch it OFF,
 * what it is FOR.
 *
 * Not alphabetical and not the record's declaration order by luck — the record
 * happens to agree today, and this constant is what keeps it true when it stops
 * agreeing. Typed against `ContainerRole`, so a fourth role is a compile error
 * here rather than a kind that silently sorts to the front.

/**
 * The bands this surface renders, in order.
 *
 * AN EMPTY BAND STILL RENDERS. That is the rule carried over from the
 * progressive-disclosure direction that was otherwise refused: a band with no
 * memberships draws as a thin labelled affordance rather than vanishing, so the
 * layout does not jump as you fill it in and so you can discover a band you
 * have never used. What decides whether a band exists is therefore CAPABILITY,
 * never CONTENT — with one exception, below.
 *
 * The policy is written per ROLE:
 *
 *   classify — exactly the kind the type answers with. A type that carries no
 *     container axis gets no band; nothing else could be true, since the value
 *     lives in a column on the item.
 *
 *   gate — needs the tables, needs an item that may join them, and needs
 *     SOMEWHERE TO GO. That last clause is the exception to the empty-band rule
 *     and it is inherited, not invented: with zero routines the band's only
 *     content is the popover's "Organize routines…" door, and item-dialog.tsx
 *     already deletes that door while the Organize console is off, because "a
 *     door that cannot open is not worth the row it costs". A band whose
 *     affordance opens an empty popover is precisely the broken-looking state
 *     the empty-band rule exists to avoid, so zero containers AND no console
 *     means no band.
 *
 *   aspire — renders from zero, and does not consult the console. Its door
 *     rides the Goals extension rather than Organize (lib/extension-gates.ts,
 *     `consoleSectionsFor`), so it opens whenever the band is allowed to exist;
 *     and a goal is the container a user is most likely to want before they own
 *     any, which is the argument the Goal chip already shipped with.
