/**
 * Overlapping schedule blocks — "Pocket & Channel".
 *
 * Until this pass existed, `ScheduleBlock` was `absolute left-0 right-1` with no
 * overlap handling at all: DOM order was paint order, so a later-derived block
 * simply painted over an earlier, longer one and took its title, its time range
 * and its bottom resize edge with it.
 *
 * ── The idea ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Three overlap topologies, three silhouettes, and each one is an EXISTING mark
 * transformed rather than new chrome:
 *
 *   NESTED (a 7h session containing a 3h task) — the rail moves INWARD. The
 *     container keeps its exact extent, full width and full rail; it drops its
 *     emission wash to ambient and sinks a POCKET where each child sits, with one
 *     6px branch tick in its lane at the child's start. The child is a normal
 *     block inset NEST_PX left and flush right, on a SOLID fill. Containment is
 *     something you read, not damage.
 *
 *   CROSSING (10–12 and 11–13) — the rail DUPLICATES. Greedy first-fit columns
 *     with COL_GAP of visible grid between plates; each column carries its own
 *     complete lane, so the accent still has real extent on the grid.
 *
 *   DOUBLE-BOOKED (two things at 09:00) — the rail THICKENS. All members share
 *     ONE band and ONE lane: only the panes tile. Member k's 2px swell sits at
 *     `5 + pitch·k` so n adjacent stripes read as one fat rail, and the beads
 *     overlap so member 0's canvas punch-ring cuts a crescent out of the one
 *     behind it — two pins in one hole. That is the whole conflict signal: no
 *     badge, no warning colour, no dotted border.
 *
 * ── Two extents, and why ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A pane is floored at PANE_MIN_H, so a short block COVERS MORE TIME THAN IT
 * OWNS: at hourPx 40 a 15-minute item paints 57 minutes of grid. Clustering,
 * column packing and free-band subtraction therefore run on the PAINTED extent,
 * while classification and every drawn mark use the TRUE one. Getting this
 * backwards means two consecutive items read as a conflict.
 *
 * ── Invariance ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The containment gate is measured in MINUTES, never pixels. `useFitHourPx`
 * rescales on every window resize, so a pixel gate would flip a nested pair into
 * a double-booking and back as you drag the window edge. Rendering may degrade
 * with hourPx; topology may not.
 *
 * The pass is pure. An entry with no overlap is absent from the returned map, and
 * the renderer then emits today's markup byte-for-byte — an uncrowded day pays
 * nothing for this file existing.
