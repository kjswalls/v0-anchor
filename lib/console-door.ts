/**
 * console-door.ts — how a control opens the Organize console from anywhere.
 *
 * The console is a COMPONENT, not a route: `OrganizeConsole` is mounted exactly
 * once, in AppShell (components/shell/app-shell.tsx), which only `app/page.tsx`
 * renders. Every other route in the app — /item/[id], /goal/[id], /settings,
 * /ledger — deliberately skips AppShell, so on those routes the console is not
 * merely closed, it does not exist.
 *
 * That makes `openDialog({ type: 'organize' })` on its own WORSE THAN A NO-OP
 * off the planner. `ui-store` is a module singleton and survives client-side
 * navigation, so the armed slot outlives the press: the door does nothing where
 * it was pressed, and the console then springs open unasked on the next trip
 * home. /goal/[id] and /settings each found this the hard way and each answered
 * it privately — arm the slot, then push '/' — and this module is that answer
 * stated once, so the next surface does not have to find it a third time.
 *
 * ── THE CONSOLE DECLARES ITSELF, RATHER THAN THE SHELL DECLARING IT ─────────
 *
 * `ItemDialog` renders in three shells (AppShell, DesktopShell's docked panel,
 * and /item/[id]'s local panel) and only two of them are under a console, so a
 * door cannot answer "is one on screen" from its own code. `usePathname() === '/'`
 * would answer today and lie the moment a second route mounts AppShell.
 *
 * The obvious React answer is a context provider wrapped around the tree that
 * mounts the console — and it was rejected, because it is a line someone can
 * quietly not write. A provider that drifts from the console it describes fails
 * SILENTLY and in the expensive direction: every door inside it starts pushing
 * '/' to reach a console already on screen, remounting the whole planner on each
 * press. So the fact is registered by the one component that cannot be wrong
 * about it — `OrganizeConsole` calls `useConsoleHost()` itself — and there is no
 * second place to keep in sync. A route that mounts the console is hosted; one
 * that doesn't, isn't; nobody has to remember anything.
 *
 * The counter is module state rather than a store because nothing RENDERS off
 * it: `useOpenConsole` reads it inside the click handler, long after any mount
 * has settled, so there is no subscription to keep and no re-render to trigger.
 * It counts rather than flags so that React's StrictMode remount in development
 * (mount → cleanup → mount) cannot leave it stuck at false.

 * ONE HALF OF THE SETTINGS PRECEDENT IS NOT HERE. That page also redirects to
 * an extension's settings pane when the section it wants rides a switch that is
 * off, rather than opening a console that would close itself on arrival
 * (app/settings/[[...pane]]/page.tsx). Every door that calls this hook is
 * already inside its own `organizeOn` / `goalsOn` gate, so the case cannot
