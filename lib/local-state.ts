/**
 * "Whose state is in this browser, and drop it when the answer changes."
 *
 * ── THE PROBLEM ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Ten separate things persist to localStorage under BROWSER-GLOBAL keys —
 * `anchor-ai-settings`, `anchor-view`, `planner-storage`, `anchor-chat-history`
 * and the rest. None of them carries an account. On a shared browser they hold
 * whoever signed in last, so the next person to sign in inherits them: their
 * canvas filters name someone else's projects, the palette's "Recent" group
 * lists someone else's commands, the Beacon panel rehydrates someone else's
 * conversation, and — the sharp one — the Beacon settings page shows them
 * someone else's API key as an editable field.
 *
 * lib/settings/hydration.ts already writes this problem down ("Every store the
 * settings surface reads is localStorage-persisted under a browser-GLOBAL key
 * … On a shared browser those keys hold whoever signed in last"). Its
 * `settingsBelongToUser` gate makes the /settings route wait rather than paint
 * that state. This module is the other half: the gate stops the values being
 * READ as the wrong person's; nothing until now stopped them BEING there.
 *
 * ── WHY A STAMP, NOT A SIGN-OUT HANDLER ─────────────────────────────────────
 * "Clear on sign-out" is half a fix, because sign-out is not the only way the
 * current user changes, and most of the other ways leave no event to hang a
 * handler on:
 *
 *   1. Explicit sign-out.            SIGNED_OUT fires. Handled below.
 *   2. Account switch with no        Supabase can deliver a bare SIGNED_IN for
 *      intervening sign-out.         a different user (supabase-provider's
 *                                    hydrateSettings says so in its own note).
 *   3. Session expiry, tab closed,   NO event ever fires. The next thing that
 *      someone else signs in later.  happens is a plain SIGNED_IN on a fresh
 *                                    page load, indistinguishable from case 4.
 *   4. Plain page load, already      No event, no previous user in memory to
 *      signed in as someone new.     compare against — `hydratedUserId` starts
 *                                    null on every load.
 *   5. ANOTHER TAB adopts a new      Case 2 in every tab at once. See the
 *      user while this one is open.  cross-tab section below; the stamp alone
 *                                    makes this one WORSE, not better.
 *
 * Cases 3 and 4 are unreachable from memory: after a reload the app has no idea
 * who wrote the blob on disk. So this module writes that down.
 * `anchor-local-state-owner` names the account whose state is currently on
 * disk; every established session compares itself against it and clears on a
 * mismatch. That is the same move morning-store makes with
 * `settingsHydratedUserId` — an explicit "whose is this?" field instead of
 * inferring ownership from a coincidence — differing only in that this one has
 * to survive a reload, so it is persisted.
 *
 * ── CROSS-TAB (case 5) ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The stamp is global; the stores are per-tab. Supabase broadcasts SIGNED_IN to
 * every open tab, so on an account switch the first tab to arrive clears, wipes
 * the blobs and stamps the new owner — and every OTHER tab then compares itself
 * against a stamp that already matches, returns false, and keeps the previous
 * account in memory. That is worse than a missed clear: persist rewrites the
 * whole `partialize` on the very next `set()`, so the stale tab RESURRECTS the
 * previous account's blob onto disk under the new owner's stamp, and from then
 * on `adoptLocalState` returns false forever — the idempotency guard starts
 * protecting the leak.
 *
 * Hence the `storage` listener at the bottom of this file. It fires only in the
 * OTHER tabs (the writer never sees its own event), so a re-stamp anywhere is
 * what tells this tab its memory is stale. It clears the stores WITHOUT
 * touching the stamp — the tab that wrote it owns it.
 *
 * ── FAIL CLOSED, BUT NOT INDISCRIMINATELY ───────────────────────────────────
 * No stamp means nothing on disk records who wrote it. Every existing install
 * is in that state on its first load after this ships, and neither `anchor-view`
 * nor `anchor-ai-settings` has ANY server copy — no `saveSettings` call, no
 * supabase reference in either file — so a blanket clear there is permanent,
 * unrecoverable loss of things the user authored.
 *
 * So the clear has two scopes, and every persisted field is classified:
 *
 *   DISCLOSIVE — says something about a PERSON: a credential, text they wrote,
 *     names taken from their own data, times of day they keep, dates they acted
 *     on, what they recently did. Cleared under BOTH scopes, because on an
 *     unstamped browser we cannot rule out that it is someone else's.
 *
 *   INERT — says something about the SHAPE OF THE SCREEN and nothing about
 *     anyone: enum-valued layout, density, grouping and sort axes, which buckets
 *     are folded, which keys are bound. Cleared only under 'all' — i.e. when we
 *     KNOW the user changed (a stamp naming someone else, or a sign-out).
 *
 * The per-field verdicts live beside the fields, in each store's own
 * `clearUserScopedState`. The summary:
 *
 *   planner-storage        all 13 INERT — density, view mode, grouping axis,
 *                          sort/visibility toggles, week start, clock format.
 *                          Enum and boolean throughout; none is free text.
 *   anchor-view            canvasFilters / braindumpFilters DISCLOSIVE (they
 *                          hold `project:`/`group:` refs, tag names and goal ids
 *                          lifted from the account's own containers). The other
 *                          12 INERT. `adoptedLegacy` never cleared at all.
 *   anchor-ai-settings     all DISCLOSIVE — apiKey is a credential,
 *                          systemPrompt and assistantName are text the user
 *                          wrote, and provider/model name the paid vendor
 *                          account behind the key (and are incoherent without
 *                          it).
 *   anchor-morning-store   all DISCLOSIVE — the check TIME is the hour this
 *                          person gets up, the dismissal is a date they acted
 *                          on, the auto-age policy drives an unattended
 *                          mutation, and a receipt carries row TITLES.
 *   anchor-eod-store       all DISCLOSIVE — same reasons, at the other end of
 *                          the day.
 *   anchor-sidebar-settings  leftSidebarHoverEnabled INERT. Width and
 *                          open/collapsed chrome never cleared at all.
 *   anchor-keyboard-shortcuts  overrides INERT — an id→keys map, no free text,
 *                          and there is no server copy to restore it from.
 *   anchor-command-usage   DISCLOSIVE — "Recent" renders the previous person's
 *                          last actions as labels.
 *   chat transcripts       DISCLOSIVE, obviously and entirely.
 *   sweep-grace            DISCLOSIVE — keyed by the previous account's row ids.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS NEVER CLEARED, EVEN UNDER 'all' ─────────────────────────────────
 * The sidebar WIDTH and open/collapsed chrome (a property of the monitor you
 * are sitting at, per sidebar-store's own note) and view-store's
 * `adoptedLegacy` (a one-time migration marker about this browser, not a
 * preference). Theme and palette are out of scope on purpose: presentation,
 * disclosing nothing, re-applied from `user_settings` on the next sign-in, and
 * clearing them would mean reaching into next-themes' own storage and the
 * blocking pre-paint script in app/layout.tsx for no security gain.
 *
 * ── THE RESIDUE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * This makes the Beacon API key stop OUTLIVING its owner's session. It does not
 * make localStorage a good place for a credential. The standard this repo holds
 * everywhere else is `user_secrets` — service-role only, with
 * /api/reminders/secrets answering which keys are set and never what they are —
 * and the Beacon key should move there under its own ticket.
