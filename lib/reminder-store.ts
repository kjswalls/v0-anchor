 * reminder scan — and by one surface that already waits for hydration (the
 * settings page gates its whole render on it). A localStorage mirror could
 * therefore only ever be WRONG in a way nobody notices until Anchor is silent:
 * a stale `remindersEnabled: true` shows a switch that is on while the row that
 * actually governs delivery says off. The server is truth, so it is the only
