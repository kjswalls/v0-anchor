/**
 * How a Schedule grid answers a grouping — lanes, or focus (Phase 5b).
 *
 * The grid cannot take section headings: a row's y position IS its time, so a
 * heading either breaks the axis or floats free of it. The partition has to go
 * on x instead, and x is not free — a channel below MIN_CHANNEL_PX is not a
 * readable block. So there are two answers, and which one applies is arithmetic
 * rather than preference:
 *
 *   LANES — x subdivides into one band per group. Lanes NEST INSIDE overlap
 *     resolution rather than replacing it: `placeSiblings(sibs, area, depth)`
 *     already derives its channel budget from `area`, so handing it a lane's band
 *     instead of the field's makes every existing rule — column packing,
 *     containment, the inset cascade, the content-band pass — run inside a lane
 *     exactly as it ran inside the field.
 *
 *   FOCUS — no lanes at all. Every block keeps full geometry; picking a group
 *     recedes the others. Costs zero pixels, which is why it is the answer
 *     wherever lanes cannot be afforded or cannot be honest.
 *
 * TIME BUCKET gets neither. The grid declines it and the Anytime strip answers
 * alone — see the guard in `planLanes`.
 *
 * Three things force focus, all for different reasons:
 *
 *   WEEK, always. At every derived default on every common monitor a week column
 *     is arithmetically EXACTLY ONE 140px channel. There is nothing to divide.
 *
 *   ROUTINE, always, on any variant. Routine membership is many-to-many and the
 *     grouping branch is first-claim-wins, so a lane cannot express
 *     insert-into-B versus move-to-B. It is focus-only on the schedule in every
 *     version, not just this one.
 *
 *   PAST THE BUDGET. There is deliberately no "Other" lane: folding the trailing
 *     groups into one names groups it cannot spatially distinguish, which is a
 *     channel that lies. The whole view falls back to focus instead, where every
 *     group is reachable at full geometry.
