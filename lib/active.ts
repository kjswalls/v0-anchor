 * exists because one predicate had been copied into three surfaces and the
 * copies drifted. Suppression is going to be asked by MORE surfaces than
 * "past due" ever was — the grid, the past-due bar, the EOD review, the
 * braindump, Beacon's context, the agent projections, search — so it gets a
 * single home before the first copy can happen, not after the third.
 *
 * Everything here is pure and string-based. Nothing reads a store and nothing
 * calls `new Date()` for "today" — callers pass the day, which is what makes
 * the whole thing testable and timezone-stable.
 *
 * Three layers answer "is it live": the item's own pause, the routines holding
 * it, and the programs holding those (or holding it directly). They combine
 * through the path algebra in {@link isItemActiveOn} — read that first; the
 * rest of this file is its supporting cast.

 * See memory/plans/programs-routines.md, locked decisions 3 and 4.
