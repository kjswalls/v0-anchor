/**
 * sweep-grace — the resume grace for suppressions that leave no trace.
 *
 * Plan decision 9 says the auto-age sweep must be pause-aware in BOTH
 * directions: suppressed items are excluded while they are hidden, AND they get
 * the trailing window to be dealt with once they come back. Excluding alone
 * only defers the mass-unschedule, because `daysOverdue` counts from startDate
 * and a suppression never moves it — so age accrues through the whole hidden
 * period and everything resurfaces already past the line.
 *
 * Most of the grace is answerable from stored data, and where it is, it stays
 * there: `pausedUntil` records an item's or a routine's resume, and a program's
 * `startsOn` / `updatedAt` cover its range opening and its manual flips. Those
 * arms are strictly better than this module, because a row travels — resume on
 * your phone and the laptop's sweep still sees it tomorrow.
 *
 * This module exists for the causes that leave NO row behind:
 *
 *   - Deleting a container that was suppressing its members. The container
 *     leaves the store's array entirely (soft-deleted rows are filtered out of
 *     resolution by design), so there is nothing left to read a resume date
 *     from — and its members reappear carrying every day of accrued age.
 *   - Removing an item from a container that was suppressing it. The join row
 *     is gone; the same problem, one row smaller.
 *   - Pulling a routine out of the program that was holding it off.
 *
 * All three are ordinary tidying gestures, and all three currently end with the
 * item visible, ancient, and one overnight sweep away from being unscheduled.
 *
 * DEVICE-LOCAL, and that is a real limitation rather than a shrug: delete a
 * routine on your phone and your laptop's sweep will not know. It is the same
 * trade the sweep's own once-per-day stamp already makes
 * (`morningAutoAgeLastRunByUser`), for the same reason — this is a "do not
 * bother the user about these yet" flag, not account state. Closing the gap
 * properly means a column on `items`, which decision 8 forbids container
 * operations from writing.
 *
 * Written as plain functions over localStorage rather than a zustand store:
 * nothing renders from it, `lib/morning-store.ts` (its natural neighbour)
 * already imports planner-store so putting it there would make a cycle, and the
 * one reader is inside an effect that is deliberately not reactive.
