/**
 * stakes/beeminder.ts — put the day on a graph that costs money to break.
 *
 * The best evidence-to-effort ratio of anything in Tier 3, and the reason is
 * that dsul is not trying to be the commitment device here — Beeminder
 * already is one, with a payment rail, a derailment ladder and years of
 * behaviour behind it. This posts the datapoint and gets out of the way.
 *
 * TIMING. Datapoints go up TWICE over, and that is the design rather than an
 * oversight:
 *
 *   - **On completion**, the moment the box is ticked (lib/stakes/live.ts).
 *     This is the one that matters. A Beeminder goal's deadline defaults to
 *     midnight and the settlement defaults to 03:00, so a settle-only datapoint
 *     arrives three hours after the goal has already decided you missed it —
 *     with the right `daystamp`, so the graph ends up correct, and after a
 *     derailment that does not un-happen on its own.
 *   - **At settle time**, as the backstop. Not every completion goes through a
 *     browser: the lock-screen action, the agent API and an offline tick all
 *     reach the database by other routes, and a goal that silently derails
 *     because one of them did not phone home is the exact failure this feature
 *     exists to prevent.
 *
 * Both write the SAME ledger row (`stake_events`, unique on user+date+subject+
 * channel), so whichever gets there first claims it and the other finds it
 * committed and does nothing. One datapoint per habit per day, from two paths
 * that never coordinate.
 *
 * Datapoints are posted for HITS only. That is not an omission: a do-more goal
 * derails on the ABSENCE of data, which is exactly the mechanism, and posting a
 * zero would actively defeat it by satisfying the goal's rate with nothing.
 *
 * A completion that is later UN-ticked withdraws its datapoint (the ledger row
 * carries the datapoint id for exactly that) and drops the ledger row, so the
 * graph never claims a day the app does not. See retractDatapoint below.
 *
 * Config:  username, goals ("Vitamins: vitamins, Reading: read")
 * Secrets: authToken
