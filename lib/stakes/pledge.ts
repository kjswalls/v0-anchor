/**
 * stakes/pledge.ts — the anti-charity ledger.
 *
 * A miss costs a stated amount, payable to an organisation the user actively
 * dislikes. That specificity is the mechanism: the money going somewhere you
 * would hate to fund is what makes the loss vivid, and a generic fine is a much
 * weaker version of the same idea.
 *
 * DSUL DOES NOT MOVE MONEY, and says so wherever a user can see it. There is
 * no payment rail here and no attempt to look like one — this records what is
 * owed, tells the user, and optionally tells a witness. A commitment device
 * that silently failed to collect would be worse than no device at all, because
 * the user would go on trusting it while it did nothing. Anyone who wants the
 * money to actually move is pointed at the Beeminder extension, which has the
 * rail this deliberately lacks.
 *
 * What it buys, then, is a real ledger and a real witness — which is most of
 * what a deposit contract is, minus the escrow.
 *
 * Config:  amount ("10"), currency ("GBP"), charity, witnessUrl
 * Secrets: none.
