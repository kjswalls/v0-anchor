/**
 * stakes/copy.ts — the words a settled day is reported in.
 *
 * Its own module for the reason lib/reminders/copy.ts is: these sentences are
 * the intervention. The copy contract from that file applies here too and is
 * harder to keep, because this is the surface that reports failure — and a
 * ledger that editorialises is a ledger people stop opening.
 *
 * The rule that follows: STATE THE ARITHMETIC. "Missed: reading. Owed: £10." is
 * a fact the user can check and act on. "You let yourself down again" is the
 * same information plus an insult, and it is the version that gets the
 * extension switched off — which is the one outcome that guarantees the stake
 * never works.
