/**
 * day.ts — what a finished day concluded.
 *
 * Pure, string-based, and the ONE place "was this a hit or a miss" is decided.
 * Every stake adapter reads this rather than asking the items itself, so a
 * Beeminder datapoint and a pledge ledger row can never disagree about whether
 * Tuesday happened.
 *
 * THE THREE-WAY SPLIT, and why it is not two. An occurrence on a settled day is
 * a hit, a miss, or NEITHER — a skip is neither. That is not a technicality: a
 * skip is the user saying "not this one, deliberately", and charging for it
 * would make the honest gesture the expensive one and teach people to just let
 * things lapse silently instead. dsul already treats a skip as a discharged
 * obligation everywhere else (isOpenLoopOn); money must not be the exception.
