 *                          something, and a disabled row would say it doesn't.
 *   not honoured + note  — inert here. Disabled, reason on the rail.
 *
 * Unhonoured values stay VISIBLE rather than vanishing: a menu whose sections
 * appear and disappear as you switch layouts is harder to learn than one whose
 * rows explain themselves — and a hidden row cannot account for the clause the
 * trigger's count is still adding up, since neither setScope nor setLayout
 * clears canvasGroupBy.
 *
 * Only one combination is genuinely inert now, and it is inert because the view
 * already answers the question.
