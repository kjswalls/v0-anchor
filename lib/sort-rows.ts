/**
 * Row ordering applied POST-DERIVATION, for the surfaces that can take it.
 *
 * Two passes live here and they share one rule about where they may run:
 * `sortRows`, the user-chosen Ordering, and `sinkCompleted`, the always-on rule
 * that finished work drops to the foot of its group.
 *
 * Never inside `deriveDayItems`. That function is shared by all six canvas
 * surfaces, and two of them depend on its comparator for correctness rather
 * than for looks: `inferDropTime` (lib/dnd/infer-drop-time.ts:42-69) resolves a
 * drop as "30 minutes before/after THAT ITEM's time", not as a slot index, so
 * "the gap above row X" only means "just before X" while the row above X is
 * earlier in the day. Re-sort the timed spine and a drop lands at a time that
 * contradicts where the row visibly went.
 *
 * That is also why Ordering is offered on List only. Sorting just the untimed
 * sub-section of a Buckets card was considered and rejected: a sort control
 * that silently governs half a card is worse than none.
 *
 * `sinkCompleted` DOES reach that untimed sub-section, and the difference is
 * not a softening of the rule above — it is that the two passes displace
 * different things. An Ordering is a menu value that claims the surface it is
 * attached to, so honouring it on half a card breaks a promise the control
 * made. The sink makes no claim and has no control; what it must not do is
 * overwrite an order the USER authored. The untimed section has none — its
 * order is "habits, then tasks, then whatever the derivation emitted" — while
 * the timed spine's order IS each row's own `startTime`, which the user set and
 * which `inferDropTime` then reads back. So the spine keeps its clock and the
 * untimed rows take the sink, on Day × Buckets only; Week × Buckets has no
 * spine at all (its cells carry no per-row droppable) and takes it whole.
 * See the call sites in components/views/*.tsx for the per-surface reasoning.

/**
 * Is this row FINISHED on the day it is being drawn for?
 *
 * Two rules, and which one applies is decided by recurrence, never by type:
 *
 *  - A recurring item's completion is per-DATE (`completedDates`), never the
 *    scalar `status` — migration 016's semantics, and the reason a habit ticked
 *    today must not read as finished on every other day of the week.
 *  - A one-shot item's is its scalar `status`, compared against the registry's
 *    `doneStatus` for its type rather than a literal. The vocabularies differ on
 *    purpose (`completed` for tasks and custom types, `done` for habits) and are
 *    external contracts the OpenClaw plugin parses, so this asks the registry
 *    which value means finished instead of testing for either.
 *
 * `cancelled` and `skipped` deliberately do NOT count. `doneStatus` is the only
 * field in the registry that names a finished state; there is no "terminal
 * statuses" set to ask, so treating those two as done would mean hardcoding one
 * member of each vocabulary and asserting they mean the same thing — the exact
 * merge the legacy-projection contract forbids. It is also what the rows
 * already say: `data-completed` is false on both, a cancelled task is not
 * struck through, and a skipped occurrence renders in its own minimized form.
 *
 * `dateStr` is NULLABLE and the null case is load-bearing, not a convenience: a
 * dateless surface (the braindump) has no day to resolve a recurring item's
 * completion against, and TaskRow already refuses to draw one as completed
 * there (`suppressCompletedLook`, issue #181). Passing null keeps this predicate
 * in step with what the row renders — a recurring row that shows no completion
 * mark must not move as if it had one.

/**
 * Finished work sinks to the foot of its own group.
 *
 * ALWAYS ON, and not a fourth setting. The app already has two controls for
 * completed rows and both are about whether they are there at all — the global
 * `showCompletedTasks` and the Display menu's `hideFinished` — so this only ever
 * takes effect for a user who has asked to keep seeing finished work. A toggle
 * to undo it would be a preference whose entire job is to restore the state the
 * two existing preferences already reach by removing the rows.
 *
 * A PARTITION, not a comparator. Stability inside each half is then structural
 * rather than a property of Array#sort: both halves are appended in the order
 * they were walked, so an Ordering already applied by {@link sortRows} survives
 * intact within each half, and 'default' rows keep the derivation's own order.
 *
 * Returns the SAME ARRAY when the split is trivial, the convention `sortRows`
 * sets for 'default': a list with nothing finished, or with nothing unfinished,
 * is already in this order.

 * like `sortRows`, and for the same reason — see this file's header. The one
