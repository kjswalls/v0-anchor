/**
 * channel-config.ts — what each delivery channel needs from the user, as data.
 *
 * ONE declaration feeds three things that would otherwise drift apart: the
 * settings records that render the inputs, the API that validates a write, and
 * the allow-list that stops user_secrets growing unbounded jsonb. A channel that
 * grows a field adds it here and nowhere else.
 *
 * The split between `config` and `secrets` is a security boundary, not a
 * grouping. Anything in `config` lands in user_extensions (RLS'd to the owner,
 * so the browser reads it back and the settings page can show it). Anything in
 * `secrets` lands in user_secrets, which has its grants revoked from
 * authenticated entirely — the settings page is told only whether a key is SET.
 * Putting a token in the wrong list would silently make it readable, so the
 * lists are the thing to be careful about, not the UI.
