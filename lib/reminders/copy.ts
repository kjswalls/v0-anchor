/**
 * copy.ts — what a nudge actually says.
 *
 * Its own module, and pure, because the words ARE the intervention here. Every
 * channel this feature grows (a push notification, a speaker in the kitchen, a
 * phone call, an SMS) has to say the same thing in its own register, and the
 * moment two of them compose their own sentence the design decisions below stop
 * being decisions and become whatever each adapter's author felt like.
 *
 * THE COPY CONTRACT. Anchor does not open by telling you what you are behind
 * on — see the BarCopy note in components/ai/morning-check.tsx, and the
 * "Still waiting" heading in lib/item-registry.ts that was deliberately not
 * called "Overdue". A reminder is the surface most tempted to break that rule
 * and the one where breaking it costs most: punishment reliably teaches
 * avoidance of the PUNISHER, so a scolding notification trains people to turn
 * notifications off. Two rules follow, and both are load-bearing:
 *
 *   1. Name the behavior, never the failure. "Vitamins" — not "You still
 *      haven't taken your vitamins."
 *   2. State a stake only as a fact, never as a threat. "12 days" is a number
 *      the user earned. "Don't lose your streak!" is a different sentence with
 *      a different effect.

 * costs. It still says it as arithmetic rather than as an accusation.

 * rather than a cheerful "all done!", which is a notification the user did not
 * ask for and cannot act on.

 * The nudge as a sentence to be READ ALOUD.
 *
 * A notification and a speaker are not the same medium and must not share a
 * string. A notification has a title line and a body line and the reader
 * controls the pace; a speaker gets one shot, in passing, from across a room,
 * and the listener cannot scroll back. So this joins into one spoken sentence,
 * drops the interpunct (which a TTS engine reads as a pause at best and as
 * nothing at worst), and puts the item FIRST — by the time someone has looked
 * up from what they were doing, the first word is already gone.
 *
 * It also stays short on purpose. A speaker announcement that outstays its
 * welcome is the fastest way to have the whole extension switched off.
