/**
 * deliver.ts — fan one nudge out to every channel the user has turned on.

 * The registry below is the extension point: a new delivery route is an entry
 * in CHANNELS plus a manifest entry in lib/extension-registry.ts. The scan does
 * not know how many channels exist and never has to.
 *
 * ISOLATION IS THE CONTRACT. Channels are dispatched concurrently and every
 * rejection is caught here, so a smart-home token that expired last week cannot
 * stop the push notification that has worked every day. A channel that throws
 * is reported as failed and nothing else happens — which is why `deliverNudge`
 * resolves rather than rejects, always.
