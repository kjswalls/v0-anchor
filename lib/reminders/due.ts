/**
 * due.ts — the ONE definition of "does dsul owe you a nudge right now?"
 *
 * Written the way lib/active.ts and lib/overdue.ts were, and for the same
 * reason: this predicate is about to be asked by the reminder scan, the last
 * call, every delivery channel and (from Tier 3) the nightly settlement, and
 * four copies would drift. Everything here is pure and string-based — nothing
 * reads a store, nothing calls `new Date()` for "now". Callers pass the day and
 * the minute, which is what makes it testable and timezone-stable.
 *
 * It deliberately does NOT re-derive what "still wants doing" means. That is
 * isOpenLoopOn + isItemActiveOn in lib/active.ts, and reimplementing either
 * here would be exactly the drift the reminder is worst placed to survive: a
 * notification about a habit the grid has already hidden is not a cosmetic bug,
 * it is the app nagging someone about something they explicitly paused.
 *
 * See memory/plans/habit-reminders.md.
