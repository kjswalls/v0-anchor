/**
 * nudge.ts — the payload contract every delivery channel consumes.
 *
 * One resolved nudge, already worded, already deduped, already checked against
 * suppression. A channel's job is to say it in its own register — a push
 * notification, a sentence read aloud in the kitchen, a phone call, an SMS —
 * and NEVER to re-derive whether it should be said. That decision belongs to
 * lib/reminders/due.ts and is made once, so that adding a fifth channel cannot
 * add a fifth opinion about whether a paused habit deserves a nudge.
 *
 * `items` is on the payload for the channels that speak a list rather than show
 * one: a speaker reading "reading, vitamins and stretching are still open" needs
 * the names, and a channel that had to look them up would need the store, the
 * suppression context and the timezone — i.e. all of the scan, again.
