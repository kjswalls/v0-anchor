/**
 * channels/call.ts — the phone rings.
 *
 * Behind the `phone-call` extension, off by default, and the only channel here
 * that can genuinely interrupt someone.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. A notification can be dismissed without being processed —
 * that is most of why reminder features plateau. A ringing phone cannot: you
 * have to decide. That is also exactly why it is dangerous, so two defaults do
 * the work of keeping it usable:
 *
 *   1. It declines ordinary cues. `kinds` defaults to ['last-call'] — once a
 *      day, at the point where the day is nearly spent, about something with a
 *      streak on it. A call for every morning cue is how this gets uninstalled
 *      in a week, and a channel whose default setting makes people hate it is
 *      not a feature.
 *   2. It says the thing and hangs up. No menu, no "press 1" — a call that
 *      demands navigation while you are holding something is worse than the
 *      notification it replaced.
 *
 * Config:  to, from, kinds (default last-call only), voice (Twilio TTS voice)
 * Secrets: accountSid, authToken
