/**
 * channels/voice.ts — say it out loud, in the room where the habit happens.
 *
 * Delivers through Home Assistant's TTS service to whichever media players the
 * user names. Behind the `voice-announcements` extension, off by default.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT JUST A LOUDER NOTIFICATION. The evidence this whole feature
 * rests on says habits form by pairing a behavior with a stable CONTEXT, and a
 * phone is the least context-bound object a person owns — it is in the same
 * pocket in the kitchen, on the train and at a desk. A speaker is not: the
 * kitchen speaker only ever fires in the kitchen, which makes it a better cue
 * for a kitchen habit than any notification can be.
 *
 * Config (user_extensions.config, browser-readable):
 *   baseUrl   — e.g. https://home.example.com  (Nabu Casa or your own domain)
 *   players   — comma-separated media_player entity ids
 *   ttsEntity — the tts.* entity to speak through (default tts.google_translate_say)
 *   kinds     — which nudges to speak (default both)
 * Secret (user_secrets.reminder_secrets.voice, service-role only):
 *   token     — a Home Assistant long-lived access token
