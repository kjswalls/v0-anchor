/**
 * channels/types.ts — the interface every delivery channel implements.
 *
 * Locked deliberately early, before there was more than one channel, because
 * the whole point of the design is that Tier 2 (a speaker, a phone call, an
 * SMS) and anything after it are ADDED rather than woven in: a channel is a
 * manifest entry, a deliver() and nothing else. The scan never learns their
 * names.
 *
 * A channel MUST NOT throw to signal a delivery failure — return a failed
 * result instead. One misconfigured integration must never be able to stop the
 * other channels, or the user's push notification (the one that always works)
 * starts depending on whether their smart-home token expired.
