 * which method, which body". Executing that plan is the transport's job. The
 * point of the split is that every semantic Anchor's agent API enforces —
 * whole-set membership replacement, pause-as-a-verb, container-by-name,
 * goal-role eligibility, the demoted-roles response — keeps living in ONE place
 * (lib/agent-api.ts) instead of being re-implemented here. A tool surface that
 * re-derived those rules would drift from them, and the drift would look like
 * the model lying about what it did.
 *
 * Descriptions are written for a model, not a changelog: they say what the tool
 * is FOR and name the trap it would otherwise fall into.
