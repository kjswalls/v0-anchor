 * One-time nudges — a tiny declarative catalog, the same bargain the extension

 *
 * A "nudge" is a single orientation message shown to a user ONCE and never
 * again: first-run copy that points out a feature or a setting, not a recurring
 * reminder and not an error. Dismissal is stored server-side (a per-user set,
 * migration 040), so "never again" spans devices and survives a reload.
 *
 * The id is permanent: it is the dismissed-set key AND the persisted value, so
 * renaming one un-dismisses it for everyone who had. Add, never rename — the
 * same rule the extension slugs live under.
