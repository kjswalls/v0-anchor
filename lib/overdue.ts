/**
 * overdue.ts — the ONE definition of "past due".
 *
 * Before this file the predicate lived in three places that had already drifted
 * apart: components/ai/morning-check.tsx (the banner), lib/item-registry.ts
 * (Beacon's chat context) and lib/commands/registry.ts (the `goto.overdue`
 * command). None of them guarded recurrence, which meant a daily chore anchored
 * to some date in April was reported as overdue every single morning forever —
 * planner-store's toggle deliberately never moves a recurring item's scalar
 * `status` (it writes completedDates instead), so a recurring item is
 * `status: 'pending'` for the rest of time. lib/day-items.ts has always had the
 * guard; this module brings everyone else onto the same rule.
 *
 * Everything here is pure and string-based. Nothing reads a store or `new
 * Date()` — callers pass the day, which is what makes the whole thing testable
 * and timezone-stable.

/**
 * Every item that is past its date and still wants doing, in display order.
 *
 * An item qualifies when all of these hold:
 *  - its type is `carryForwardEligible` and `dateAnchored` (registry capability
 *    — habits are neither, custom types are both, see buildCustomTypeConfig)
 *  - it is NOT recurring. A recurring item's misses are per-date state, not a
 *    property of the item, so it can never be "past due" as a whole.
 *  - `status === 'pending'`. That is the only non-terminal task status, so this
 *    one check also excludes 'completed' and — deliberately — 'cancelled',
 *    which the agent API can write (openclaw-plugin/src/tools.ts:88,
 *    TaskStatusSchema) but which has no UI producer and no inverse. A cancelled
 *    item must never reappear in a surface whose only exits assume it can be
 *    completed.
 *  - it has a startDate strictly before `todayStr`.
 *
 * Sort: the recent cohort first, newest first (what you most plausibly still
 * care about), then the earlier tail oldest first, which puts the deepest end of
 * the list at the bottom rather than buried in the middle of it. Ties keep store
 * order — Array#sort is stable.
 *
 * Return type note: custom-type items are date-anchored and carry-forward
 * eligible, so they DO come back from here, narrowed to `TaskItem`. That
 * narrowing is structural, not literal — CustomItem is taskShape plus a
 * `customType` — and matches what components/ai/morning-check.tsx has always
 * done. `itemTypeName(t)` still returns the real registry name at runtime.
 *
 * @param items  the store's unified `items` array (NOT the `tasks` projection —
 *               the registry lookup wants the discriminated item). Accepts a
 *               readonly array so the registry's context renderers can pass
 *               their `readonly Item[]` slice straight through.
 * @param todayStr yyyy-MM-dd for "today", already timezone-resolved by the caller
