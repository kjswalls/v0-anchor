 * openclaw-gateway.ts — dsul's side of the OpenClaw gateway conversation.
 *
 * SERVER ONLY. The gateway token is full operator access to the user's gateway
 * — the docs are blunt about it — so it must never reach a client component or
 * the browser bundle. The browser talks to dsul; dsul talks to the gateway.
 * That is a CONVENTION here, not a guarantee, and it is worth being honest
 * about which: `createServiceClient()` throws without SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY, but
 * only when called — importing this module into a client component would
 * bundle it silently and fail at runtime, not at build. The token itself is
 * never in the bundle (it is read from the database, server-side), so what the
 * mistake would cost is a broken screen rather than a leak. The `server-only`
 * package would make it a build error; it is not a dependency of this
 * workspace, and adding one for a single import is the trade not yet taken.
 *
 * Transport is the gateway's OpenAI-compatible surface
 * (`POST /v1/chat/completions`, opt-in via
 * `gateway.http.endpoints.chatCompletions.enabled`), chosen over the WebSocket
 * protocol because it streams real SSE, fits a Next route handler, and needs no
 * per-browser Ed25519 device pairing. The tradeoff is no tool-call events — an
 * acceptable one while chat is an escape hatch rather than the main surface.
