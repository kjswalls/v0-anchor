 * `(user_id, name)` — no `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL` — so a soft-deleted
 * container reserves its name for the full 30 days while being invisible to
 * this store, whose arrays come from `deleted_at`-filtered fetches. The
 * `alreadyExists` guards above therefore cannot see the row that is about to
 * reject the insert, and the insert used to fail into a bare
 * `.catch(console.error)` AFTER the optimistic `set()` had landed.
 *
 * What that left behind is worse than a missing container. Every later edit to
 * it is an `.eq('id', …)` matching zero rows, so it accepts a glyph, a colour
 * and a whole time block and keeps none of them — and because
 * `items_project_id_fkey` is a COMPOSITE foreign key, any item filed into it
 * has its own INSERT rejected with 23503 in full. The item dialog's inline
 * "new project" is the sharp end: type the name of a project you deleted last
 * week, save, and you lose the project AND the task you were writing, with the
 * only evidence a console line nobody will read.
 *
 * Healing it HERE rather than at the call sites is the point. The console's
 * create rows consult the bin and refuse with a sentence (see
 * use-trashed-names.ts) — that is the good path, and this is the net under it,
 * covering the item dialog, the command palette, and anything added later,
 * without the async lookup a synchronous action cannot await.
 *
 * The rollback leaves no trace in history: it is not a user action, so it
 * pushes no entry of its own (a bare `set()` here would be a labelless mutation
 * landing as "Unknown action"), and the failed create's own entry is stripped
 * of the phantom and relabelled — see forgetFailedContainer.
 *
 * WHAT IT CANNOT DO. If the user's Save wins the race — the item's INSERT goes
 * out before the container's rejection comes back — that item is already lost
 * to 23503 and nothing here retrieves it. Clearing the reference stops the NEXT
 * save carrying it; the one already in flight is why the proactive refusals in
