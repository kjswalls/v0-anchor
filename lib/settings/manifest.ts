/**
 * Every setting Anchor surfaces, as data.
 *
 * ONE declaration feeds the /settings page, its search index, and the
 * `data-setting` e2e handles. The palette's `settings.*` commands are still
 * hand-declared in lib/commands/registry.ts — that group owns keyboard
 * shortcuts and a globally-unique alias namespace guarded by an exhaustive
 * unit test, so folding it in here is a separate change. tests/unit/
 * settings-manifest.test.ts asserts the two can't drift into an alias
 * collision in the meantime.
 *
 * WHAT BELONGS HERE. A durable default you set once and forget — the shape of
 * a day, how the app is drawn, what runs unattended. Working state does NOT
 * belong here even when it persists: scope, layout, typeFilter, groupBy, the
 * filter popovers, week density, collapsed buckets and the sidebar width all
 * live one click from the surface they affect, where you can see the change
 * land. Sending someone to a settings page to change something they'd have to
 * navigate back to evaluate is the loop this page exists to avoid.
 *
 * WHAT DOESN'T. Settings that persist but no view reads (compact mode, chill
 * mode, morning check time, default view, right_sidebar_hover, assistantName).
 * CLAUDE.md keeps their columns and setters as-is; leaving them out of the
 * manifest is what stops search deep-linking to a control that does nothing.
 * See memory/plans/deferred-settings-features.md for the ones that are coming
 * back once the feature behind them exists.
 *
 * PANES ARE TWO LEVELS, and only under Extensions. The rail is the map and it
 * stays at seven entries; an extension gets a pane of its OWN below it, at
 * `extensions/<slug>`. Every one of those is generated from the catalog in
 * lib/extension-registry.ts — there is no hand-written pane per extension and
 * there must never be one, because the whole promise of the extension surface
 * is that adding one is adding config. See EXTENSION_PANES for the rest.
