/**
 * scope-rail.ts — the scope (routine/program) view-model.
 *
 * One row per gate container: the switch the user set on it, the state that
 * actually resolves today, and a line saying what that switch is currently
 * doing. Everything hard is here, pure and date-parameterized.
 *
 * It powers the Display menu's "Paused scopes" list — the off scopes, each one
 * click from back on. The sidebar rail that first grew this is gone (its two
 * jobs moved onto the group-header switch and that menu list), but the
 * view-model it needed outlived it.
 *
 * The load-bearing rule, out of the path algebra rather than out of taste:
 *
 *   **Local state on the switch, effective state in the luminance.** A routine
 *   keeps its own `pausedAt` while a program suppresses it. Render that routine
 *   as "off" and resuming the program hands back a routine the user believes
 *   they turned off — so the switch always shows the STORED value and the row's
 *   dimming shows the RESOLVED one. They never merge. Only routines can
 *   disagree; a program has nothing above it.
 *
 * See memory/plans/programs-routines.md, Phase 5.
