/**
 * The item page — stage 3 of the surface (dialog → panel → page,
 * memory/plans/item-surface-growth.md). A deep-linkable route for when the
 * item IS the work: properties and subtasks on the left, the thread on the
 * right. Property editing stays in the panel (the Edit button opens the same
 * ItemDialog this page mounts locally — the shell's instance lives in
 * AppShell, which this route deliberately doesn't render).
 *
 * Auth follows the app's client-side model: the root layout's
 * SupabaseProvider hydrates the store when a session exists; without one this
 * page simply has no items and shows the not-found state with a sign-in link.

/* ── The editor, deferred until Edit is pressed ────────────────────────────
   ItemDialog is the app's largest single component and it drags react-day-picker
   in behind it (the start-date field). Deferring it takes 90.3 kB gzip off this
   route's first load (396,875 → 306,564 bytes: clean production builds of both
   commits, the route's own script tags, shared chunks deduped, gzip -9) — for a
   panel that opens on a button press and is closed on arrival every time. What
   is left is 7.8 kB above /ledger, the lightest route in the app and so the
   nearest thing to the baseline every route pays. /ledger itself moved +210
   bytes across the same pair of builds, which is the noise floor these deltas
   sit on.

   `ssr: false` because the panel renders nothing while closed, and the page it
   sits on has no session server-side to render an item from anyway.

   MOUNTED ON FIRST OPEN AND KEPT, never unmounted on close: next/dynamic
   fetches the chunk when the component first RENDERS, so leaving it mounted at
   `state={null}` would download it on page load and split nothing. `everOpened`
   below is that latch, and the DOWNLOAD is its whole justification — there is
   no exit animation here to protect: `presentation="panel"` hard-returns null
   while closed (see SurfaceContent, whose own note says the e2e suite asserts
   the surface reaches count 0 after a close). Unmounting on close would defer
   the download just as well — `{editState && …}` needs no latch at all — and is
   not chosen only because the app's other two ItemDialogs live mounted for the
   whole session (see the trashed-names fetch inside it, gated on `state` for
   exactly that reason), so this one matches them rather than inventing a third
   lifecycle. */
const ItemDialog = dynamic(

/* The chip and the identity square are the BAND vocabulary now
   (components/planner/item-bands.tsx) — the same marks the edit panel uses, so
   the two surfaces read as one grammar rather than two that resemble each
   other. Aliased rather than renamed at every call site below. */

  /* Field selectors, not the whole store. `usePlannerStore()` bare subscribes
     to the store OBJECT, which zustand replaces on EVERY set(), so this page
     re-rendered its whole thread on any planner mutation anywhere in the app.
     Said honestly: no such tick was found reaching this route while it sits
     idle. The obvious candidate is not one — hover writes go to a module ref
     (lib/hovered-item.ts), planner-store's `setHoveredItem` has no caller left
     in the repo, and SubtasksSection renders its own rows rather than TaskRow.
     So this is not a fix for an observed stall; it is a narrowing that is
     correct and free, on a page whose only live input is one item. Selecting
     the item itself rather than `items` narrows it further: `find` returns the
     same object identity until that one row actually changes. */
