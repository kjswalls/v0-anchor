/**
 * POST /api/agent/items/:id/progress — a worker says where it has got to.
 *
 * Was the generic task PATCH, which verified only that the row belonged to the
 * caller's ACCOUNT. That left the delegation loop's central race wide open:
 *
 *   Worker A marks an item `working` and is slow but alive. An hour later the
 *   user, seeing no update, taps Try again — the item goes back to `queued`.
 *   Worker B picks it up and finishes it. Then A, still running, reports
 *   `done` with its own result, and the write lands unconditionally on top.
 *
 * The user opens the item and reads A's report — written against a premise they
 * had already discarded — with B's result gone from the panel. Worse if A
 * reports `blocked`: the item flips back from finished to "needs you", asking a
 * question from the run they killed.
 *
 * So this route is a COMPARE-AND-SET on `ai_status_at`. A worker passes the
 * stamp it last read; the write is refused if the item has moved since. That is
 * what makes the UI's Try again honest rather than merely rare — before it, the
 * button's whole safety argument was that a double run was unlikely.
 *
 * `lastSeenAt` is optional, because a worker taking a never-touched item has no
 * stamp to send. Absent, the write proceeds — an unconditional first report is
 * exactly what it should be.
