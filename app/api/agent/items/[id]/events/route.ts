/**
 * GET /api/agent/items/:id/events — one item's activity trail.
 *
 * The agent's read side of the delegation loop. When a worker marks something
 * `blocked` and asks a question, the user's answer is appended here as an
 * `agent_reply` event; this is where the worker comes back for it. Also lets an
 * agent see what has happened to an item it is picking up mid-flight, rather
 * than starting from a title and a status.
 *
 * Deliberately its own route rather than an addition to /api/agent/context:
 * that response is `safeParse`d whole by the OpenClaw plugin, which THROWS on
 * drift — one bad field there bricks the plugin's entire cached context. A new
 * route can only break the caller that asks for it.
