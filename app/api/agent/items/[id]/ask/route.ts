/**
 * POST /api/agent/items/:id/ask — the agent asks the user something answerable
 * in one tap.
 *
 * `dsul_report_progress` with status `blocked` already lets a worker ask a
 * question; what it cannot do is offer ANSWERS. Most of the questions that
 * actually block delegated work are choices, not essays — which Dana, which of
 * the two invoices, is Thursday still fine — and making the user retype a name
 * into a box is the difference between a loop that closes in a second and one
 * that waits until they have the energy to compose a sentence.
 *
 * Does both halves in ONE call, and — unlike every other event writer — WAITS
 * for the question to land before flipping the status. An earlier version of
 * this route claimed atomicity it did not have: `recordItemEvent` is
 * fire-and-forget by design, so the insert could be lost (or never sent at all,
 * if a serverless invocation froze the moment the response returned) while the
 * block stuck. The user would then see the question with no buttons, and the
 * tool result would have told the agent it had offered them.
 *
 * So the question is written FIRST and awaited. If it fails, nothing changed
 * and the agent gets an error it can retry. If the status flip then fails, the
 * event is an orphan — harmless, because the panel only offers buttons for a
 * question that matches the item's CURRENT `aiResult`, and nothing renders a
 * reply box at all unless `aiStatus` is `blocked`.
 *
 * Its own route rather than a field on the task PATCH, for the reason the
 * sibling events route gives: `/api/agent/context` is `safeParse`d whole by the
 * OpenClaw plugin, which THROWS on drift, and every `taskShape` field spreads
 * into that frozen projection. Options ride in `item_events.payload`, which is
 * `jsonb` and was designed to absorb exactly this.
