          is layered over rather than replacing:

          radialGain 0.2 starts the ring calm at the focal and lets it grow
          hotter outward. Under the frost that is exactly the right shape — the
          field is quietest under the glass, where the copy sits, and hottest
          out at the margins where the tiles come back crisp.

          pointerFocus leans the focal a fraction of the way toward the cursor,
          and it leans away from focalX/focalY — which this page has moved onto
          the sign-in column. So the field tilts around the content rather than
          around the middle of the window. The frost does NOT follow: the glass
          stays put while the wave shifts under it, which is what makes it read
          as glass rather than as a spotlight.

          The denser pitch is deliberate under a 26px blur — 44px tiles blurred
          that far lose their identity and go to soup, while 30px ones stay a
          legible texture through it. */}

          behind it on purpose: the ripple is born under the glass and the rings
          only sharpen once they've travelled out past the falloff.

          Tint + blur + saturate are one recipe, not three options. The BLUR is
          what quiets the field: at this radius the tiles dissolve into soft
          bloom and the layer reads as a glass lens laid on the page, which is
          the whole effect. The tint only keeps type off the field's brightest
          crests, and the saturate stops the lime going grey once the blur has
          spread it thin.

          The inverse — a light blur under a heavy tint — was tried and
          rejected. It leaves the tiles' rounded-square shape legible through
          the veil, so the field reads as merely dimmed, and it costs the
          falloff its edge: a blur boundary announces itself as a lens, where a
          tint gradient can only dim. If this ever needs to be quieter, widen
          the mask's opaque core before reaching for the tint.

          --modal, not --card: per the ramp note in globals.css, --card is the
          top of the dark ramp and reads as a lamp at any real size.

          The mask and the backdrop-filter MUST sit on the SAME element. A mask
          on an ancestor makes that ancestor a "backdrop root", which empties
          the backdrop a nested backdrop-filter would sample — the blur then
          silently renders nothing while the tint still looks fine, so it fails
          as a subtle wash rather than as an obvious break. */}
