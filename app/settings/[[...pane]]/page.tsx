/**
 * Settings, as a route.
 *
 * Follows the /item/[id] precedent — no AppShell, no canvas-container, the
 * root layout's SupabaseProvider supplying hydration and theme. Which means
 * this page has to do, by hand, the four things AppShell was doing for free:
 *
 *   1. The <html data-type-mode> stamp. AppShell is its ONLY writer, so without
 *      this the Typeface row would appear to save and change nothing — the
 *      worst failure shape available.
 *   2. flushSettings() on pagehide AND on unmount. Writes are debounced 500ms
 *      and a Next client-side navigation fires no pagehide at all, so leaving
 *      via the breadcrumb inside that window would silently drop the patch.
 *      The dialog literally could not do this; a route can.
 *   3. The modals the settings surface hands off to. ConfirmDialog and
 *      BugReportDialog are mounted only by AppShell, so dispatching to them
 *      through ui-store from here would set state that nothing renders. The one
 *      the surface opens BY NAME is lazy — see `openLocalDialog`; ConfirmDialog
 *      stays eager because it is answered by a store, not by this component,
 *      and a confirm that arrives before its dialog has downloaded is a prompt
 *      nobody sees.
 *   4. The hydration gate. Every store here is localStorage-persisted under a
 *      browser-global key, so before Supabase settles this page would render
 *      the PREVIOUS account's values as live controls — and a click inside that
 *      window writes someone else's preference to this user's row. The gate is
 *      `settingsBelongToUser` (lib/settings/hydration.ts), and it waits for the
 *      SETTINGS request only: it used to also wait on planner-store's
 *      `isLoading`, which is the seven-table item load this route never reads,
 *      and which the settings request usually beats anyway.

/* ── The one modal this page opens by name, deferred ───────────────────────
   Reached only from a row the user clicks: Anchor → Send feedback. Deferring it
   takes weight off this route's first load — measured across the PR that
   introduced the split at 40.6 kB gzip for the two modals that were deferred
   together, spent on surfaces most visits never open.

   THE SECOND ONE IS GONE, and that is the better outcome than deferring it:
   the keyboard shortcuts table used to be a modal this route summoned from an
   `action` row, so /settings/keyboard was a room whose only furniture was a
   door. The bindings are settings records now (SHORTCUT_RECORDS in
   lib/settings/manifest.ts) and the pane renders them itself, so there is no
   modal here to split off — the same table is still summonable with ⌘/ over the
   planner, from the shell that mounts it there.

   `ssr: false` because it has nothing to say before hydration and is already
   client-only (it captures a screenshot of the live document).

   next/dynamic fetches a chunk the first time the component RENDERS, not the
   first time it is opened, so this must not be left permanently mounted at
   `open={false}` — that downloads it on mount and the split buys nothing.
   `openLocalDialog` below is the other half: it latches a mount flag that is
   never cleared, so the chunk is fetched on the first open and the modal then
   STAYS mounted, keeping the close animation Radix needs a live subtree for. */

     record (home === the 'day' fallback) it correctly does nothing. Dropping

     record's own pane keeps those links working and, more usefully, makes
     ?focus= self-routing: the id is enough, the pane no longer has to be
     right. It settles in one hop — after the replace the panes agree.

     `isPaneId(home)` is not belt-and-braces: PaneId is an open template literal
     now, so `pane: extensionPaneId('beemindr')` type-checks. Without the gate a
