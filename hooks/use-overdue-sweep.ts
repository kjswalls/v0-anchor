/**
 * use-overdue-sweep — the OPT-IN "auto-clear stale items" decay (user decision D1).
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES
 * Once per calendar day, per user, per device, it takes every past-due item
 * that has been past due for MORE than `morningAutoAgeDays` days and
 * unschedules it — the item loses its startDate/timeBucket/startTime and falls
 * into the Braindump. Nothing is deleted, nothing is marked cancelled (D2:
 * there is no archive verb), and the whole sweep is one undoable step.
 *
 * WHY IT IS OFF BY DEFAULT
 * `morningAutoAgeEnabled` defaults to FALSE. This is a background mutation of the
 * user's data that they did not initiate and may not be looking at when it
 * happens, so the out-of-the-box behaviour has to be exactly today's behaviour:
 * nothing moves unless the user touches it. Decay is something you opt into after
 * you have decided the past-due pile is noise, not something the app decides for
 * you. Every gate below is written to fail CLOSED — any doubt (settings not
 * hydrated, data not loaded, an unresolved timezone, a nonsensical threshold)
 * means "don't sweep".
 *
 * WHY EVERY INPUT IS PROVEN TO BELONG TO THIS USER BEFORE ANYTHING MOVES
 * This hook is the only unattended writer in the app, and its inputs arrive on
 * three independent, unordered channels: items (planner-store's
 * initializeStore), settings (supabase-provider's hydrateSettings), and
 * localStorage (zustand persist, browser-global, written by whoever used this
 * profile last). Nothing sequences those channels, so "the planner finished
 * loading" says NOTHING about whose auto-age settings are in memory — and on a
 * shared browser, or on a second device where the setting was switched off
 * elsewhere, the value sitting in localStorage belongs to someone else or to
 * an older decision. Every consumer of that state can afford to be briefly
 * wrong and self-correct on the next render; this one cannot, because it
 * writes. So it waits for a positive, per-user signal on each channel:
 * `settingsHydratedUserId === userId` for settings, and a non-null
 * `userTimezone` for the day boundary. Both are subscribed values, so the
 * sweep re-arms the instant they resolve rather than depending on which
 * request happened to land first.
 *
 * WHY ONCE PER DAY
 * The sweep is idempotent in outcome but not in feel: re-running it on every mount
 * or every focus would fire an undo toast repeatedly, and each run would push
 * another history entry, evicting the user's real undo stack (planner-store caps
 * history at MAX_HISTORY_SIZE=50). `morningAutoAgeLastRunByUser` is stored
 * LOCAL-ONLY on purpose — it is a "have I already bothered you today on this
 * device" flag, not a piece of account state worth syncing — but it is keyed by
 * userId, because on a shared browser a single string meant the first person to
 * sign in that day silently consumed the second person's sweep.
 *
 * WHY THE BATCHED ACTION
 * It calls `unscheduleTasks(ids)`, not a loop over `unscheduleTask(id)`. The
 * batched action does ONE `set()`, which means one history snapshot, one undo
 * toast, and one Cmd+Z to reverse the entire sweep. A loop over 40 stale items
 * would push 40 deep clones of the item array, blow away the user's earlier
 * history, and require 40 presses of Cmd+Z to put things back — which for an
 * unattended background mutation is effectively "not undoable".

    // (:475), so `!isLoading` is also true for the entire pre-login window when
    // `items` is `[]`. `userId` is null until that same set(), so
    // `userId && !isLoading` is the real "load has started AND finished" edge.
    //
    // Sweeping an empty array is harmless in itself (selectOverdue returns []),
    // but it would still stamp the last-run date and suppress the real sweep for
    // the rest of the day. `error` is checked for the same reason: a failed
    // fetch also lands on `isLoading: false` with empty items.
    //
    // A partially-loaded array can't happen here — initializeStore does a single
    // Promise.all followed by a single set() — but if that ever changes, this
    // gate is the place that has to grow.
    //
    // That single-set() property is now load-bearing for ROUTINES and PROGRAMS
    // too, not just items. Both fetches ride the same Promise.all and land in
    // the same set() that clears `isLoading`, so passing this gate guarantees
    // membership is known — which the suppression exclusion and the container
    // resume-grace below both depend on. Hydrate either separately (a lazy
    // fetch, a second effect) and this sweep starts running against an empty
    // container list: every member of a paused routine or an off-season program
    // reads as unprotected and gets unscheduled in one silent batch. If they
    // ever move out of that Promise.all, they need their own gate here FIRST.

    // GOALS joined that list for a third reason, and it is the sharpest of the
    // three. This sweep clears `startDate`, and on a milestone that field is
    // not stale scheduling residue — it is the target date, the only record of
    // when the checkpoint was meant to happen. `unscheduleTasks` subtracts
    // milestone-role items before it writes, so it needs the goal list to be
    // populated; hydrate goals separately and the sweep sees none, reads every
    // milestone as an ordinary stale task, and erases a year of target dates in
    // one unattended batch that no toast even announces.

    // `userTimezone` is set only by hydrateSettings and is absent from
    // planner-store's partialize, so it is null on every page load. The old
    // `|| Intl…resolvedOptions().timeZone` fallback therefore resolved to the
    // MACHINE zone whenever the items request beat the settings request, and
    // stamping the run date made that wrong day boundary permanent for the day:
    // at UTC+13 vs UTC-4 the two disagree about which calendar day it is for
    // several hours, which is the difference between "past due by 30 days" and
    // "past due by 31" — i.e. between skipping an item that should be swept and
    // unscheduling one a full day early. Every other consumer of the fallback
    // (the bar, the goto.overdue command) re-renders and self-corrects; this one
    // writes and then suppresses its own retry, so it is the one place the
    // fallback is unacceptable.
    //
    // NOTE: gate 2 does not subsume this. `timezone` is a nullable column and
    // hydrateSettings stores `settings.timezone?.trim() || null`, so a hydrated
    // user can legitimately have no zone — an account whose row has never been
