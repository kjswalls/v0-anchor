/**
 * Store-connected wrapper around deriveDayItems — the single data path for
 * every canvas view.
 *
 * PLURAL is the real hook; `useDayItems` is the one-element case. It reads that
 * way round because of Week × Schedule: it needs all seven columns resolved
 * before it can render any of them (the shared hour range spans the union of
 * every day's items), so it cannot call a per-date hook from a column child the
 * way Week × List and Week × Buckets do. Given only a singular hook, its only
 * option was to inline deriveDayItems itself — which is what it did, as a
 * verbatim copy of this file's body including the inactiveItemIds block and its
 * comment. Two implementations of one pipeline, and the canvas filter work adds
 * a rule to it every phase.

   * inert (nothing selected, nothing selected that is still a live goal, or —
   * since the Goals extension — the whole feature switched off); see
   * lib/goals.ts and lib/extension-gates.ts.
   *

   * six view mounts. Inert and not empty is what makes switching Goals off
   * safe on a surface that was filtered by one: `passesGoalFilter` reads `null`
   * as "do not narrow", so every row the clause was hiding comes straight back.

   * The RESOLVED date strings, which is now exactly the derivation's input:
   * `deriveDayItems` takes a `dateStr` and nothing else that says which day this
   * is. It used to take a `Date` beside it and read `getDay()`/`getDate()` off it
   * — browser-local, while `toDateStr` resolves in `timezone` — so two instants
   * could share a dateStr and disagree on the weekday, and only an exact-instant
   * key was safe. With that gone the mapping is total: same dateStr in, same
   * derivation out, whatever instant produced it.
   *
   * Resolving them is memoized on the INSTANT key — strictly finer than the
   * dateStr key below, so it cannot serve a stale string — because `toDateStr`
   * builds an uncached `Intl.DateTimeFormat` per call (~50µs, against ~0.05µs to
   * read `getTime()`). Week × Buckets mounts 28 cells that each call this, and
   * dnd-kit re-renders every droppable on each collision-target change while the
   * planner deps are untouched. Doing it in the render body cost ~1.3ms on every
   * one of those.
