/**
 * Does this action get said out loud?
 *
 * Two ways in, and the second is not a widening of the first. A prefix in the
 * list above says "this VERB is consequential enough to offer an undo for". A
 * receipt on an `Add ` verb says something narrower and stronger: the store
 * attached one only because the item it just created is not visible where the
 * user just put it (plan decision 11), which is the exact condition this toast
 * exists for — and creating is far too ordinary a verb to list. An item created
 * straight into a program that is currently off is gone from the grid the moment
 * the dialog closes, and the list alone would let that happen in silence while
 * the bulk "Add to …" path announced the identical write.
 *
 * Scoped to the `Add ` prefix rather than "any receipt at all", because the
 * other receipted verbs are not ready to speak and each needs its own fix
 * first:
 *
 *  - `Edit task:` attaches its receipt on `'startDate' in updates` — key
 *    PRESENCE, not change — and the mobile modal commits the whole DRAFT_KEYS
 *    payload on every Save, so changing only a priority on a task in a paused
 *    program would toast. It needs `updates.startDate !== task.startDate`
 *    there before a receipt on it means anything.
 *  - EOD's "Move all to tomorrow" carries N suppressed rows through that same
 *    action; React batches them into ONE toast, which names one arbitrary row
 *    and whose Undo reverses only that row.
 *  - The undo/restore paths in the morning triage and EOD write the saved
 *    scheduling fields back through it too, so a REVERSAL would announce
 *    "hidden where it landed" about the thing it just put back.
 *
 * None of that is this rule's to settle, so it stays on the path whose receipt
 * was audited: the create path.
 *
 * Exported for the unit test, which is the only place the rule can be checked:
 * the hook itself needs a store and a subscription to say anything.
 *
 * The name outlived the surface. The row is a strip above the dock now, not a
 * toast (components/notices/undo-strip.tsx) — but this is the same audited
 * predicate over the same action labels, and renaming a rule in the commit that
 * moves it makes every future failure ambiguous about which change caused it.
 * The `morning-bar` testid was kept across its own move for the same reason.
