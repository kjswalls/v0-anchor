 * store which was only ever handed four handlers, and a hardcoded listener in
 * AppShell that owned the other seven ids and never read the store — so
 * rebinding undo, redo, either sidebar, settings, shortcuts or search silently
 * did nothing. The hardcoded one also skipped the focused-input guard, which
 * is why ⌘Z while typing in the omnibar undid a *task* instead of a keystroke.
 *
 * Bindings come from the registry (a command owns its shortcut); the two
 * hovered-item shortcuts are passed in because they need shell state.

 * a focused row: `n` opens the add dialog and REPLACES the console in the
 * single ActiveDialog slot, `v` switches the planner view behind it, `?` opens
 * the shortcuts modal, and `⌫` matches `delete_hovered`, which preventDefaults
 * before any local handler runs while lib/hovered-item.ts may still be pointing
 * at a task on the canvas. Typing a routine's name would destroy the surface
 * being typed into.
 *
 * Only bare bindings are withheld. Every mod-combo (⌘K, ⌘Z, ⌘,, ⌘\) keeps
 * working, so the app's chrome is never trapped behind a local surface.
 *
 * Queried lazily — only once a bare binding has actually matched — so the
 * common keystroke costs an array scan and no DOM work.
