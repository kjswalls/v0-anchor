  // write access to pausing is a deliberate Phase 4 decision, so strip it here.
  // PATCH needs no equivalent: TaskUpdateSchema/HabitUpdateSchema are
  // hand-enumerated and drop unknown keys.

  // projectId is stripped for a different reason, and permanently. The agent
  // surface speaks in NAMES — that is the entire point of the legacy projection
  // — and an agent holds no id↔name map, so a body carrying both could only
  // disagree with itself. Accepting one would mean choosing which half wins on
  // every drifted POST. `project` stays the agent's field; `lookupContainerId`
  // in lib/db.ts resolves the id from it on the create AND update paths, so an
  // agent-filed item is linked correctly without ever naming an id. That

  // of 400ing here (the rule the `aiStatus` line beside it states outright), and
