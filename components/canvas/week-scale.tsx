/**
 * The week scale — how wide a day column is, as a notched slider.
 *
 * Lives on the canvas header row beside the header capsule rather than inside
 * it: the capsule's pill answers "what am I looking at" (type · layout · scope)
 * and is already at its horizontal budget, while this answers "how big", which
 * is a different question and one that only exists in two of the six views.
 * Sitting at the far end of the same `canvas-container` row puts it on the
 * right edge of the grid it scales, at every window width and in both the
 * capped and full-width canvases.
 *
 * ── What the control says, and what it stores ──
 * It READS OUT A COLUMN WIDTH, and it stores a day count.
 *
 * The readout was the day count for this control's first release, on the
 * argument that the width is what the setting resolves to rather than what it
 * means. The argument had a hole: "5 days" is a claim about the canvas that the
 * view breaks whenever the stop is clamped, and it broke it often — the number
 * said five while six and a half columns were on screen, or while four were and
 * the grid scrolled. A width makes no claim it can fail; it is measurable off the
 * screen at any moment. Days moved to the hover explanation, where the
 * qualification ("about 5 of 7 fit, and the grid scrolls") can travel with them.
 *
 * The stored preference stays a day count, because a stored WIDTH stops meaning
 * the same thing the moment the canvas resizes: open the item panel and a stored
 * 260px is four and a half columns, where "five days" is still five. So the
 * control displays one and remembers the other, which is also why the readout can
 * change without anyone touching it.
 *
 * ── Why the ladder is measured, not fixed ──
 * The slider's value is an index into the RUNG ladder — one rung per distinct
 * column width available on this canvas, which is a subset of WEEK_DAY_STOPS
 * (see weekRungs). Stops that resolve to the same width are one position, so
 * every notch is a visible change. Before that, Week × Buckets on a 13" canvas
 * offered four notches that all rendered identically.
 *
 * Mounted unconditionally and self-hiding, so the header row's layout doesn't
 * have to know about it.
