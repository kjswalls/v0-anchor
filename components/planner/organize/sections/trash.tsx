 *
 * THE BIN MUST NOT ENTER THE STORE, and this is law rather than tidiness.
 * `saveToHistory` snapshots five slices, and `applyHistoryState` reads "present

 * `projects` would be soft-deleted AGAIN by the next ⌘Z, restamping
 * `deleted_at` and silently resetting its 30-day purge clock. Redo is worse: it
 * would un-delete rows the user never restored. Keeping the bin in a local hook
 * makes all of that unreachable rather than merely unlikely.
 *
 * It is also the only HETEROGENEOUS list in the console — five tables in one
 * column — which is why its row is its own component rather than ObjectRow. A
 * trash row has no selection, no count and no pill; it has a kind, a date and
 * exactly one verb.
