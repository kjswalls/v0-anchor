/**
 * OVERVIEW — the console's front door.
 *
 * The plate used to open on Routines, which is a fine section and a poor
 * greeting: a first-time arrival met a list of one kind of thing with no word
 * about the other five. This is the map — every available section, what you have
 * of it, one line on what it is for, and a way to make another.
 *
 * It takes the WHOLE body rather than the list+detail pair. There is nothing to
 * select here and nothing to detail; a 300px column of six rows beside an empty
 * pane would be the layout arguing with its own content. Trash proved a section
 * may use the space its own way (it takes no selection); this one goes further
 * and takes no columns.
 *
 * CALM, deliberately: hairlines between rows rather than six bordered cards, a
 * SHORT phrase rather than each section's full definition — the definitions live
 * in the sections themselves, where they are the empty state and the create
 * form's hint, and repeating them here would be the same six paragraphs twice.
 *
 * The trash row carries NO COUNT, and that is the bin's law rather than an
 * oversight: trashed rows never enter the store (see sections/trash.tsx), so a
 * count here would mean a fetch on every console open to answer a question
 * nobody asked.
