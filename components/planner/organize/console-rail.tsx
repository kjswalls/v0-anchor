/**
 * The Organize console's navigation: a grouped VERTICAL rail, never a tab strip.

 * bearing rather than convenient — it is what keeps
 * `getByRole('tab', { name: 'Routines' })` resolving, which
 * `tests/e2e/programs.spec.ts` drives the manager with. Phase 2's
 * acceptance criterion is that that spec runs
 * UNCHANGED. It also gives roving tabindex and ↑/↓ traversal for free, and
 * `key={section}` remains the remount trick that makes a second open on a
 * different section actually land there.
 *
 * Proven before it was built: `tests/unit/organize-rail.test.tsx`.
 *
 * IMPORTED FROM THE PRIMITIVE, NOT `components/ui/tabs.tsx`. The wrapper's
 * TabsList is `bg-muted inline-flex h-9 w-fit rounded-lg p-[3px]` with `flex-1`
 * triggers — precisely the full-width segmented strip this design exists to get
 * away from, and every one of those classes would have to be nulled anyway.

/**
 * EVERY SECTION NAMES THE EXTENSION IT RIDES — or names none, which is a third
 * answer rather than a missing one.
 *
 * Five of the seven ride the console itself. The other two are the whole reason
 * this is a field instead of a branch in the rail:
 *
 *   GOALS rides EXT_GOALS. This is where a goal is CREATED, so if it rode the
 *     console then switching Goals on with the console off would buy a filter,
 *     a grouping and a page for goals you have no way to make.
 *
 *   TRASH rides NOTHING — `extension: null`, ungatable by construction. It is
 *     the only way back out of a delete (see sections/trash.tsx), and DELETION
 *     IS NOT GATED: items, projects, routines, programs, habit groups and goals
 *     all still delete freely with the console off. Gating only the recovery
 *     half means the app's DEFAULT configuration — both extensions off, which
 *     is what every new account gets — can destroy work with no cross-session
 *     route back. ⌘Z is session-scoped and fifty deep; it is not the answer.
 *     Gating the bin because of the room it happens to stand in is gating by
 *     HOUSING rather than by MEANING, which is the exact mistake "The Weight of
 *     Anchor" exists to correct — and the rail already says so, pinning trash
 *     below a rule as a lifecycle surface rather than a peer of either group.
 *
 * So with both extensions off the console still opens, holding one row: Trash.
 * That is the same shape as the Goals-only case, and both are pinned in
 * tests/unit/extension-gates-organize.test.tsx.
 *
 * Declaring it per-section is the registry bargain the rest of the app makes
 * (lib/item-registry.ts, lib/container-registry.ts): the next gated section is
 * a field, not a code path.
