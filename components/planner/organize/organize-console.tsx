/**
 * ORGANIZE — one console for every container and label.
 *
 * Replaces ManageCollectionsDialog (680px) and ManageCategoriesDialog (400px).
 * The full rationale, the three rejected container directions and the adversarial
 * verdicts are in memory/plans/organize-console.md; only the load-bearing
 * mechanics are repeated here.
 *
 * WHY A MODAL, given Settings became a route. Frequency. Every journey reviewer
 * independently found the same thing: this is a PERIODIC surface — under thirty
 * objects, one person, opened monthly. The modal keeps four things a route
 * forfeits: the vaul bottom sheet for free (which ManageCategoriesDialog never
 * had — it is a 400px centred box on a phone today), both e2e `closeManager`
 * helpers unchanged, focus trap and focus-return, and AppShell's services —
 * DndContext, the undo toast, and ⌘Z, which every delete confirm's copy now
 * explicitly promises.
 *
 * The console body is deliberately a COMPONENT rather than a dialog body, so
 * adding `/organize` later is an additive PR that renders this same tree rather
 * than a rebuild. Buy the URL when the URL is wanted.
 *
 * GEOMETRY — 938 × 640, fixed aspect, sized from the columns up:
 *   rail 180 | 1px | list 300 | 1px | detail 456   = 938
 *   header 48 + body 560 + footer 32               = 640
 * It needs a 1002×720 viewport, so it fits 1280×800 with 278×80 to spare. Fixed
 * is the point: the frame never resizes on a section change, which is the
 * loudest un-premium tell in both dialogs it replaces.
 *
 * GROUND — every pane sits on `bg-modal`. There is NO background step anywhere
 * inside the plate; depth is the hairline, full stop. A rail on `--surface-1`
 * over `--modal` is a 0.6% step in light (invisible) and a 3.2-point step in
 * dark, and the obvious fix inverts because `--surface-3` is LIGHTER than
 * `--modal` in dark. Removing the step removes the per-theme problem entirely.
