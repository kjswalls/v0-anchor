/**
 * THE ESCAPE LADDER — Escape backs out of one thing at a time, and only leaves
 * the console when there is nothing left to back out of.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AS A REGISTRY, when four `e.stopPropagation()` calls look like
 * they would do the same job: they do not work, at all. Radix's DismissableLayer
 * binds its Escape handler with
 *
 *     ownerDocument.addEventListener('keydown', handler, { capture: true })
 *
 * (`@radix-ui/react-use-escape-keydown`), so it runs on the CAPTURE path, at the
 * document, before the event has begun descending toward the focused input. By
 * the time any React `onKeyDown` fires, the dialog has already been told to
 * close. Stopping propagation there stops nothing — the decision is made.
 *
 * A capture-phase listener of our own on `document` does not fix it either:
 * same target, same phase, so Radix wins on registration order, and Radix
 * registered when the plate mounted.
 *
 * So the ladder goes through Radix's own door instead. `onEscapeKeyDown` is a
 * DialogContent prop, it fires before the close, and `preventDefault()` on it
 * keeps the plate open. The console asks the ladder whether anything wants the
 * press; if something does, it consumes it and the plate stays.
 *
 * Each rung decides for ITSELF whether the press is its own — normally "am I
 * focused, and do I have something to clear" — so no ordering rule is needed
 * and two rungs can never both claim one press.
 *
 * NOTE this is also a live bug in `manage-collections-dialog.tsx`, which has
 * carried the same dead `stopPropagation` rungs since it shipped. It goes when
 * that file does.

/**
 * Is this node in the section the user is actually looking at?
 *
 * TODAY THIS ALWAYS RETURNS TRUE, and it is kept anyway. Radix's `Tabs.Content`
 * renders `{present && children}` — the panel element exists for every section
 * but only the ACTIVE one has a subtree, so only the visible section's rungs are
 * ever registered. Verified, not assumed: a probe render of the plate finds one
 * `organize-list` and one filter field, and five panels with zero children.
 *
 * It stays because that is a property of Radix's default, not of this console.
 * Adding `forceMount` to preserve a section's scroll position — an entirely
 * reasonable future change — would mount all six at once, and without this guard
 * a search box left open in Routines would silently eat the Escape you pressed
 * while looking at Programs. One `closest()` call is a cheap way to make that
 * change safe instead of subtly broken.
