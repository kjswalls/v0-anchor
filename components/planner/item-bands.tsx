/**
 * item-bands.tsx — the band as a thing you can see, on both surfaces.
 *
 * lib/item-bands.ts decides WHICH bands exist and in what order; this file is
 * what one looks like, and it is shared by the edit panel (where a band's
 * content is a live picker) and by /item/[id] (where it is a readout that can
 * open the editor). One row, one noun, one line of height — a label column on
 * the left and whatever the surface puts on the right.
 *
 * The label vocabulary is deliberately the SAME micro-label the detail sections
 * already use for Subtasks, Activity, History and Thread: those sections were
 * bands before the word existed, and the chips above them were the only part of
 * the surface still rendering as an unlabelled heap. Making them one component
 * is what lets the whole surface read as one grammar rather than two.

/**
 * One band: the noun on the left, its controls on the right.
 *
 * `leading-7` on the label, not a padding: 28px is the chip height, so the
 * label's own line box centres it against the first row of chips and STAYS on
 * that first row when they wrap. A padding would have to be re-tuned every time
 * the chip height moved.
 *
 * The label column is a fixed 4rem so every band's controls share a left edge —
 * a ragged one is what makes a stack of short rows read as debris. Labels come
 * from the registry and are one word today; a longer one wraps rather than
 * truncating, because a clipped noun is worse than a taller row.
 *
 * NOT a `<label htmlFor>`, and PropertyChip does support one (`id`). A band may
 * hold several controls — When holds up to five — so an association could only
 * ever be right for the single-control bands, and a rule that holds for some
 * rows is worse than none. Each control carries its own `ariaLabel` with the
 * noun in it instead, which is the same information without the arbitrary half.

 * em-dash: it is the app's existing dashed-affordance vocabulary (the same
 * recipe as "Assign to Beacon" in the detail sections and as PropertyChip's own
 * unset state), carrying a plus and a verb. Dashed says "nothing here yet",
 * the plus and the word say "and you may".
 *
 * The visible word is the verb alone, because the band's label two inches to
 * its left is already the noun. The ACCESSIBLE name is the noun, so a control
 * read out of its row still says which band it belongs to.
