          hour grid whose hour labels have scrolled off the screen is just a
          field of rectangles. Four things make the pin work, none of them
          optional:

          1. It only works because the week grid dropped canvas-container's
             1100px cap (data-wide above). A sticky box is constrained to its
             CONTAINING BLOCK — this flex row — not to the scrollport, so under
             the cap the row ended at 1100px and the gutter came unstuck at
             scrollLeft > containerLeft + 1000, sliding off exactly when the
             scale control had made the grid wide enough to need it.
          2. The negative margin cancels canvas-container's left padding and the
             matching padding puts the content back, so the gutter's BOX starts
             at the scrollport edge while its labels stay where they were. Pin
             at `left-0` without it and columns scroll through the 32px of bare
             padding to the gutter's left.
          3. An opaque background, or the columns show through what they are
             supposed to be sliding under.
          4. WEEK_GUTTER_Z, which is one above the now-marker — see the constant
             for why z-10 is not enough.

          The week-nav slide lives on THIS wrapper, not on the row above, so the
          seven days slide in past a gutter that holds still. The hour labels are
          identical from one week to the next — sliding them is motion that means
          nothing, and once the grid scrolls sideways the pinned gutter visibly
          jitters 40px and back on every navigation.

          It has to be a wrapper rather than the class on each column. The
          keyframes animate opacity 0.5 → 1, and an animation overrides a normal
          declaration, so a column carrying `opacity-60` would fade to 1 and then
          SNAP back to 0.6 the instant the animation ended. On a parent the two
          opacities multiply, which is what makes it smooth today.

          The key rides here too: it is what restarts the CSS animation on a week
          change, and keeping it off the row means the gutter — and the width
          measurement anchored to that row — survive the navigation.
