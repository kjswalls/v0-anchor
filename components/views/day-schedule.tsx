/**
 * Day × Schedule (P5d, per desktop_day_scheduleView.png): untimed items in
 * an ANYTIME section up top, then an hour gutter with duration-height
 * blocks. Dropping on an hour slot schedules at the top of that hour
 * (`hour:{H}`, CONTRACT.md).
 *
 * The block + derivation helpers are exported so week-schedule reuses them.
 *
 * ── The timeline's visual language ────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every block stands beside a LANE. The lane carries a hairline rail; the item's
 * accent swells that rail to 2px for exactly as long as the event runs, and a
 * bead pins its start on the hour line. So the accent is a mark ON the grid,
 * with real extent, rather than a stripe glued to a card — and the block itself
 * is lit from the rail side (see --sched-* in app/globals.css) so the colour
 * reads as a light source instead of as a coloured container.
 *
 * On hover the block picks up drafting-style REGISTRATION MARKS: four corner
 * crops and a caliper datum centred on each resizable edge. They sit OUTSIDE the
 * pane, the way real crop marks sit off the object they register, which is why
 * the component is built as an outer positioning wrapper around an
 * overflow-hidden pane — the pane would clip them — and why a hovered block
 * raises its z-index, so a flush neighbour can't paint over them.
 */

/**
 * The pane geometry moved to lib/schedule-constants.ts when the overlap pass
 * (lib/schedule-overlap.ts) needed it: that file is pure and has to agree with
 * this renderer down to the pixel, and importing a 'use client' component into
 * lib/ would be a cycle. Re-exported here because week-schedule imports LANE_PX
 * from this module, and because the numbers still belong to this component's
 * story even when they no longer live in its file.

 * the gutter was a bordered box that read as its own object; against a bare
 * column of marks it just reads as the labels having drifted off the grid, and
 * it separated the live time from its own diamond by the width of a thumb.
