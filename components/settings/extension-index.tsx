/**
 * /settings/extensions — the index, not the switches.
 *
 * Extensions grew config faster than the pane could hold it: a channel is a
 * toggle plus up to four fields plus a credential, and seven of those in one
 * column is a wall you scroll rather than a thing you set up. So each extension
 * became a pane of its own (see EXTENSION_PANES) and this is what the rail entry
 * now opens onto — one row per extension, leading in.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY NOT A LIST OF TOGGLES. The obvious version puts each extension's
 * switch on this page as well as inside it, and that breaks two things at once:
 * `data-setting-row` stops naming one place, so the ?focus= deep link and the
 * e2e handles get two candidates for the same id; and a switch nested inside a
 * link is a target that does two different things depending on the pixel. The
 * row shows the STATE instead and the switch stays where its config is, which
 * is also where the reason it can't be turned on is written.
 *
 * Each row reads its own state behind a try/catch, for the same reason the rest
 * of the extension surface does: one extension must never be able to cost the
 * others their row.
 */

/**
 * The extension's own toggle record, found by SHAPE rather than by id.
 *
 * Two of the eight toggles predate the slug convention
 * (`extensions.habitHeatmap`, not `extensions.habit-heatmap`) and an id is a
 * permanent deep link, so an `extensions.${slug}` lookup would silently miss
 * them. Every extension pane holds exactly one switch that depends on nothing —
 * its own — which is asserted in tests/unit/settings-manifest.test.ts.

/**
 * What the row says, ASKED OF THE TOGGLE rather than re-derived here.
 *
 * An extension can be switched on and still be doing nothing, because a channel
 * rides `remindersEnabled` and a stake adapter rides `stakesEnabled` — the
 * master switches over in Rituals that `unavailable()` reports and that
 * `isEnabled()` knows nothing about. Reading the store alone made this index say
 * "On" for a Beeminder whose own pane was saying "Unavailable", and Beeminder is
 * the extension where being wrong about that costs real money.
 *
 * So the rule keeps ONE home: the record's own `unavailable()`. A second copy
 * here is how the index and the pane drift apart again.
