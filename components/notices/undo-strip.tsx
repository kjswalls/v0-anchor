/**
 * The activity row — direction C's shape, carrying direction E's ink.
 *
 * WHY IT IS NOT A NOTICE. It has no object, and it is the one thing here that
 * genuinely cannot have one: "Delete task: Swim" is about a row that no longer
 * exists. So it does not go through `placeNotices`, it does not take a rank, and
 * it never occupies the dock's one line — it sits above the dock as its own
 * transient row and leaves on its own.
 *
 * WHY IT LOOKS LIKE ONE ANYWAY. A toast and a notice are the same sentence said
 * by the same voice, and the old sonner card said it in a second visual language
 * eight pixels away from the first. Same 26px, same glyph-then-line-then-verb
 * reading, same ink.
 *
 * IT TYPES, unlike the dock's line. The rule is that anything urgent must be
 * legible instantly, and this is the least urgent thing the app ever says: it is
 * a receipt for something the user did deliberately one moment ago. The reveal
 * costs at most 640ms of a 5000ms life and is what tells the eye this row is new
 * rather than the dock line it is sitting on top of.
 *
 * The hairline is the expiry, and it animates WIDTH. Lime never takes alpha in
 * this palette, and it is its own element so no parent can fade it (CLAUDE.md).
 *
 * WHY THE CALLER OWNS POSITIONING. On the desktop this row is taken OUT of flow
 * (`absolute bottom-full`) and overlays the braindump instead of displacing it.
 * That is not tidiness — it is measured. With the chat panel expanded in a short
 * window, the sidebar column is already over-constrained, and a 26px row that
 * appears and vanishes on a 5s timer the instant after the user acts is the
 * "moves under your cursor" complaint being caused by the fix for it. Out of
 * flow, it costs the column nothing at any viewport height. The phone keeps it in
 * flow: its dock is bottom-anchored in a fixed-height column and measured 0px of
 * movement in every configuration, so there is nothing to take it out of.
 *
 * The overlay therefore needs an opaque ground from the caller (it covers a
 * braindump row) — the surface it would otherwise be sitting on.
