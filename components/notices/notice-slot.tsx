/**
 * A notice standing on the thing it is about.
 *
 * Same 26px, same ink, same glyph-carries-the-kind reading as the dock's row —
 * they are the same sentence and they should read as the same kind of row. Two
 * differences, both deliberate:
 *
 *  1. **It types.** Here there is room and there is context, and the reveal is
 *     what makes a line that appeared under your cursor read as having been said
 *     rather than as having always been there. The dock's line never types (see
 *     TypewriterText).
 *  2. **The ✕ is always drawn**, on touch as well as pointer. The dock
 *     suppresses it on touch because a 24px destructive target pressed against a
 *     full-width tap target is a mis-tap generator and its trays carry their own
 *     dismissal instead. In place there is neither a tray nor a full-bleed row
 *     to collide with, and "every notice must be easily dismissible" is the
 *     amendment this surface exists under.

/**
 * "There is a place for a notice here, and here is what is in it."

 * layout effect (lib/notice-anchors.ts), so within the same commit the dock
 * already knows this notice has somewhere better to be and never paints the
 * frame where it is still on the dock line.
 *
 * `active` is how a slot says "my object is the one this notice is about" — the
 * day-header slot is live only on today, so arrowing to another day takes the
 * anchor down and the notice goes back to the dock rather than sitting beside a
 * date it has nothing to do with.
 *
 * Renders nothing at all when there is nothing placed here, so a slot costs an
 * empty fragment and no layout on every surface that mounts one.

/**
 * Beside the date, in the canvas header row.
 *
 * The end-of-day line's object is the DAY, and the day's canonical handle is its
 * date — not the geometric foot of a grid. This is the address ProgramNotice
 * already argued its way to ("it is bound to a date… so it belongs beside the
 * date"), and E generalises that precedent rather than inventing a second one.
 *
 * It costs the row nothing: the row's height is max(children) and the header
 * capsule already sets that at 96, so an h-8 line beside it is free. The foot of
 * the day column, which this replaced, was not free — lib/use-fit-hour-px.ts
 * reserves 24px below the schedule grid and counts only the chrome above it, so
 * a 34px row down there made a compressed day scroll.
 *
 * `scope` overrides the view store, for the mobile shell: MobileViewRouter is
 * day-only and hardcodes it, while a stale `scope: 'week'` can persist in that
 * shell's blob with nothing able to correct it (see the same note on
 * DisplayMenu in components/mobile/mobile-header.tsx).
 *
 * Live only on today. On any other date the anchor goes dark and the line falls
 * back to the dock, which is the honest place for a question about a day that is
 * not the one on screen.
