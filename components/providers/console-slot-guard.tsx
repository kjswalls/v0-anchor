/**
 * Drops a stranded Organize slot when you leave the route that mounts the
 * console.
 *
 * `OrganizeConsole` lives in AppShell, which only `app/page.tsx` renders, and
 * `ui-store` is a module singleton — so a console left OPEN when you navigate
 * away keeps its slot armed at a surface that no longer exists, and the next
 * trip home springs it open unasked. lib/console-door.ts stops a DOOR arming a
 * slot it cannot open; this stops an already-open console outliving its route.
 *
 * The console's own outward links close it themselves (organize/sections/goals.tsx),
 * which covers the deliberate exits. This covers the one the user brings: browser
 * Back, the Android hardware button, the iOS edge swipe — on mobile the console
 * is a bottom sheet and back-to-dismiss is the reflex.
 *
 * KEYED ON A PATHNAME CHANGE, NOT ON UNMOUNT. The tempting version — clear it
 * when the host unmounts — is wrong in development: Next 16 leaves
 * `reactStrictMode` on for the App Router, so a mount effect's cleanup fires
 * once immediately after the first mount, and that would wipe the slot the
 * arm-then-push path had just armed to open the console in the first place. A
 * pathname change cannot fire on arrival, so it has no such window.
 *
 * Only ever clears the ORGANIZE slot. The shell's other dialogs are equally
 * unmounted off `/`, but none of them has a link that leaves the route, so none
 * can be stranded this way — and clearing a slot nothing stranded is how a
 * dialog starts closing itself for reasons nobody can find.
