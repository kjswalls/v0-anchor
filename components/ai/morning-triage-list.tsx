/**
 * The past-due triage list — the body shared by the desktop tray (a portaled
 * Popover under the 50px bar) and the mobile bottom Drawer. One component, so
 * the two platforms can never drift on what an exit does or what a receipt says.
 *
 * The list NEVER renders in flow on the canvas. That is the whole feature: the
 * bar above it is 50px at every task count, and lib/use-fit-hour-px.ts derives
 * the schedule's hour height from the space below the bar. A list that grew in
 * flow drove hourPx to its MIN_HOUR_PX floor and destroyed the fit-to-height
 * contract at ~18 overdue items.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT components/primitives/task-row.tsx: that row has no date
 * column (the age stamp is the point here), its py-1.5 + line-clamp-2 body is
 * taller than 30px so reusing it would worsen the exact problem this fixes, its
 * useDraggable is meaningless inside a portal, and its whole-row click-to-edit
 * competes with the triage gesture (in a triage list the primary click must be
 * triage, so only the TITLE opens the editor here).
 */

/**
 * NOTHING IN THIS LIST ESCALATES WITH AGE. There was an ANCIENT_DAYS = 30
 * threshold here that promoted the date stamp to --warning-text, a token that
 * flips BRIGHT in dark mode — so the oldest rows were the loudest thing on the
 * surface and the list read as a severity ranking. Age is orientation, not a
 * grade: every stamp is muted, every row is the same weight, and the only thing
 * that ever changes a row's appearance is something the USER did to it (a
 * receipt) or something that happened to the item (a stale marker). See the copy

 *
 * BOTH trailing columns reserve their width and the cluster fades IN FLOW rather
 * than being absolutely positioned (which is what the dense day row does). A
 * ~1030px tray row has slack a day list doesn't, and reserving those 176px buys
 * a straight right edge down 60 rows with zero hover shift.
 *
 * EVERY ROW LOOKS THE SAME. Not "similar" — the same: same title weight, same
 * muted stamp, same three exits, whether the date on it is yesterday's or from
 * three months ago. The only two things that may ever change a row's appearance
 * are a receipt (the user acted on it) and a stale marker (the item changed under
 * the tray). Age is not one of them.
