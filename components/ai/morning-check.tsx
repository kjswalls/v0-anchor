/**
 * The waiting notice — one line in the dock, with the list in a portal.
 *
 * "Waiting" to the reader, "past due" in the code: the predicate, the store, the
 * settings keys and the auto-age sweep all still use the internal name, because
 * that is what they compute. See the copy contract on BarCopy below for why the
 * visible word is different, and treat that contract as covering this file and
 * components/ai/morning-triage-list.tsx together.
 *
 * THE 50px CONTRACT IS GONE, AND SO IS THE REASON FOR IT. This surface used to
 * be a bar in the canvas column between the header block and the timeline, and
 * lib/use-fit-hour-px.ts:41 derives the schedule grid's hour height from
 * (viewport.clientHeight − anchorTop) — so every pixel of it was an input to the
 * grid, and its height had to be constant at every task count or hourPx fell to
 * its floor. It now lives in the sidebar dock, which nothing measures into. The
 * discipline survives the move anyway (components/sidebar/dock-notices.tsx caps
 * the stack), but it is now a choice about not crowding the braindump rather
 * than a load-bearing contract, and breaking it can no longer break the grid.
 *
 * Exports a HOOK, not a component: both docks render the same notice through
 * one row component, and only the tray body differs between them. See
 * lib/dock-notices.ts for the shape and the membership rule.

   * exactly one), the desktop rows unmount when the sidebar column collapses,

   * tray leaks across every one of those boundaries and the NEXT mount inherits

   * its own it still lets the incoming surface paint one frame with the
   * outgoing surface's open flag. Crossing the 768px breakpoint with a tray
   * open hits this in BOTH directions (app-shell.tsx:371 swaps the two shells
   * in a single commit), so the gate lives here in the shared hook rather than
   * on one platform: rendering closed until armed is what makes "never
   * auto-opens" literally true instead of merely intended.
   *
   * It costs nothing the rest of the time — `armed` is true long before any

 * dies with it. The dock capsule itself is what remains and what closes over the
 * gap, so that is the handoff target, found by name rather than by ref — one
 * fixed, labelled surface is a clearer thing to point at than a walk up a tree
 * whose shape depends on how many other notices happen to be present.

 * requires revealing the sidebar first (lib/commands/registry.ts:656), and

/**
 * THE COPY CONTRACT FOR THIS WHOLE SURFACE.
 *
 * This line is the first thing the user sees, every day, before they have done
 * anything. So it gets exactly one job: say how much is waiting, and open. It
 * does not grade the pile, it does not date the pile, and it never implies the
 * user owes anyone an explanation. If a future edit here needs a sentence to
 * justify itself, that is the signal it belongs somewhere else.
 *
 * What that rules out, and why each one was actually here:
 *  - "· oldest May 2". An aggregate age has one reading and it is "this is how
 *    far behind you are". The per-row stamps in the tray carry every bit of the
 *    USEFUL information (which day is this line about?) without summing it into
 *    a verdict. lib/overdue.ts has a longer note where the helper used to live.
 *  - "past due", as the visible noun. It is still the internal name of the
 *    predicate (lib/overdue.ts, useMorningStore, the auto-age sweep) because
 *    that is what it computes — but a bill is past due, and a bill has a
 *    penalty. "Waiting" is the same set of items with the blame taken out, and
 *    it is the word the drawer's own description has always used.
 *  - "from yesterday" was also a LIE: the predicate has no lower bound, which is
 *    exactly why April items once sat in a list titled "yesterday".
 *  - an unconditional "Good morning!" was a LIE — visibility gates on
 *    enabled && !dismissed && n > 0, never on the clock, so it greeted you at
 *    3pm. Conditioned on the hour it stays, because a greeting is the one thing
 *    on this line that costs the reader nothing.
 *  - "carry forward or clear them out?" is a question a collapsed row can't answer.
