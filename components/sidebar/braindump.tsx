            — lives on the column's own edge, and this row is left holding
            only things that act on the LIST. It also buys the title back
            ~30px, which is the difference between fitting and truncating at
            the 280px minimum width. ⌘[ is unchanged. */}

          scroll-to-bottom after each add. It fills the column only when empty, so
          the empty-state poem stays vertically centered.

          overflow-x is pinned hidden, not left alone: CSS promotes an untouched
          `visible` to `auto` the moment the other axis scrolls, so overflow-y
          here quietly made the port horizontally scrollable too — and the empty
          state's relay field, which overhangs its box by design, then poked far
          enough past the padding to raise a horizontal scrollbar under an empty
          braindump. It clips a couple of px the field's mask has already faded
