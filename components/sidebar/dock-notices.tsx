/**
 * The dock's ONE line: the highest-ranked question with nowhere else to live.
 *
 * It used to be the app's only voice, a stack of up to two rows INSIDE the dock
 * capsule. It is a strip ABOVE the capsule now, absorbed by the braindump's
 * flex-1 (desktop) and by the content area's (mobile).
 *
 * BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU CLAIM FOR THAT MOVE. The story this change was first
 * written under — "a notice arriving moved the omnibar" — was measured and is
 * false: the capsule's bottom is pinned by the column and this stack sat ABOVE
 * the UserCard, so a row grew the capsule upward into the braindump and the
 * omnibar held still at every viewport height down to 360px. What actually
 * jumped was the undo TOAST, which was position-fixed at `--toast-bottom`,
 * measured off the capsule's top edge — so it moved by exactly the row's height.
 * That is now a strip row of its own and no longer measures anything.
 * The move itself is a placement decision (notices are not part of the dock);
 * see memory/plans/notices-in-place.md for the numbers.
 *
 * WHY NOT THE CANVAS, which is where the waiting bar lived. lib/use-fit-hour-px.ts
 * derives the schedule grid's hour height from (viewport bottom − whatever sits
 * above the timeline), so anything in that column has to hold a fixed height
 * forever or it drives hourPx to its floor. The bar's famous 50px contract was
 * never a design decision — it was rent. This strip sits in the sidebar column,
 * which nothing measures into.
 *
 * WHAT IS LEFT HERE, after direction E. Most notices now render on the thing
 * they are about (components/notices/notice-slot.tsx). What reaches this line is
 * what has no object on screen — plus the two categories `placeNotices` pins
 * here whatever they claim: anything `blocked`, because a notice saying the app
 * cannot proceed must never be somewhere you have to scroll to, and anything
 * carrying a tray, because only the dock opens one. The membership rule is
 * unchanged: a line is earned by a pending DECISION, not by importance.
 *
 * THE HEIGHT LADDER, and it is not a function of n:
 *   0 notices → 0     (nothing renders at all)
 *   1+        → 26    (one row; past one the row becomes a "+N more")
 * The fold is a DEFAULT, not a ceiling — expanding lifts it — and because the
 * strip is absorbed by a flex-1 neighbour, expanding it still does not move the
 * omnibar.
 */

/**
 * Rows shown before the stack folds into a "+N more". ONE, on both platforms.
 *
 * Two was the desktop's answer when this was the app's only voice and a second
 * notice had nowhere else to go. Under E it does: the dock is the fallback, so
 * a second line here means two homeless questions at once, which is rare enough
 * to be worth a fold row and not worth a taller strip.

 * Every source, in one place. Adding a notice kind is adding a line here.

 * not by which module raised it, which is the whole reason the rank exists.
 *
 * The three that can live somewhere better come from
 * components/notices/notice-sources.tsx, which the in-place slots also call. The
 * waiting notice stays here because `useWaitingNotice` closes its tray on
 * unmount, so it must be called from exactly one place in the tree.
