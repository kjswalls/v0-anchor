 * @param onAskBeacon overrides where "Ask Beacon" opens the chat. Desktop
 *   grows the sidebar dock (default); mobile switches to the Chat tab.
 * @param onFocusChange reports the input's focus state to the parent (the dock
 *   drives its ambient relay from this — a stable signal, unlike container
 *   focus-within which sticks when a menu returns focus or a child unmounts).
 * @param onPulse fires on the INSTANT focus arrives (and on every ⌘K), for a

 *   one, so a second lit surface in the same 48px would be two fields arguing.

              A tactile "key pressed" feel.

              The states live on this WRAPPER rather than on the input, because
              the input now shares the pill with the argument chip. They are
              driven off the same `focused` state the relay uses, not
              :focus-within, which sticks when a child unmounts.

              All three properties animate, so all three need an explicit
              resting value, and every animated property is named in the
              transition list. Two things that look like details but are not:
                • Tailwind v4 presses via the standalone `translate` property,
                  NOT `transform` — listing `transform` here animates nothing.
                • The shadow uses the --shadow-key-* PAIR rather than
                  elev-sm → inset-sm. A box-shadow list whose layers disagree on
                  `inset` is uninterpolable and hard-swaps mid-transition; the
                  pair is padded so it actually cross-fades. See globals.css. */}
