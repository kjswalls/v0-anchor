                  backdrop entirely. This has to read in both themes, and
                  muted-foreground is re-pointed per theme where the alpha

                  at all — now sit on the column's own edge, and centred so it
                  reads as the seam's own control rather than as something the
                  header lost.

                  left-full puts it on the PANEL's edge rather than in the
                  middle of the gutter, matching the collapsed-state grip
                  exactly: one control, one line, whichever state you are in, so
                  collapsing and reopening never look like two different objects
                  in two different places. It overhangs the panel by 6px and
                  clears the braindump column entirely — which is the difference
                  from the 22px chip this replaced, and why it no longer reads as
                  debris wedged between two cards.

                  Centring costs one thing, and it is a deliberate trade:
                  double-click-to-reset no longer works ON the grip, because a
                  press here answers before the reset can and the first click
                  has already collapsed by the time a second would arrive. There
                  is no arbitrating that on the way down without delaying
                  collapse behind a dblclick timer, which would make the primary
                  action feel broken to save a recovery one. So reset stays on
                  the rest of the track — 656 of the sash's 696px — and the
                  tooltip names the two zones rather than saying "the sash".

                  It is a <span>, not a <button>: the sash owns pointer capture,
                  so a real button's click never fires (see endDrag) and a
                  nested focusable would put a second, mute tab stop in the
                  gutter. role + aria-label give assistive tech the button. */}

              Radix closes a tooltip on pointerdown and won't reopen it until
              the pointer leaves and returns, which is why nothing pops up over
              the canvas mid-drag or the instant you let go. The px readout is

      {/* Expand — the collapse grip's mirror: same shape, same vertical centre,
          chevron flipped. Collapsing and reopening therefore happen at one
          fixed height on screen instead of the control jumping to the panel's
          top-left corner, which is where it used to live (desktop-shell.tsx).

          It does NOT sit in the gutter the way its twin does — it straddles the
          panel's left edge, half over the canvas. The twin has to stay clear of
          both cards because it lives ON the resize track between two surfaces
          that are both present; this one has nothing to its left but 24px of
          empty backdrop, so hiding in that margin only makes the single control
          on an otherwise bare edge harder to spot. Overlapping the panel is
          what gives it a surface to cast its shadow onto and read as sitting on
          top of something.

          The 12px grip is only the MARK. The button is a full-height 32px zone
          running the length of the panel's left edge, so reopening is a throw
          of the mouse at that side rather than a hunt for a 12×32 target — the
          grip tells you where, the zone forgives you for missing.

          32px = the 24px of bare backdrop left of the panel, plus 8px over it.
          That 8px is the ceiling, not a taste call: canvas-container carries
          32px of padding and stops centring once <main> is narrower than its
          1100px cap, so on a small window real content begins 32px inside the
          panel (40px in the day grid, which adds pl-2). Widening this zone past
          that starts eating clicks meant for the view.

          A real <button>: no sash, no pointer capture, so a plain click works
          and its own tab stop is the only keyboard route to reopening.

          Gated on !isVisible rather than !leftSidebarOpen, so it also stands
          down during a hover-peek: the column is on screen then, overlaying
          this exact spot, and a control inviting you to "expand" on top of the
          panel you are already reading is noise. Unmounting it out from under a
          stationary pointer is safe — the wrapper closes a peek on its own
          onMouseLeave and this zone is one of its descendants, but Chrome does
          not re-fire enter/leave for a stationary pointer when the element
          under it is replaced by an ancestor's own subtree, and the peeked
          column covers these pixels within a frame regardless. Verified, not
          assumed: tests/e2e/sidebar-resize.spec.ts holds a peek open under a
          parked pointer and re-checks it 1.5s later. */}
