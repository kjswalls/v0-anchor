/**
 * The sidebar dock ("menu dock" in Figma): one flat gray capsule holding the
 * user menu + session history on top and the omnibar (white pill) below.
 * Exact dims from the Figma file (6ZFClj80tMQOCYUhzyuWFL): gray 406×137 r10;
 * top row at y21; omnibar pill 385×48 r10 at y72. Chat has no bar of its own
 * — when summoned from the omnibar (`?` / Ask Beacon / ⌘]) it mounts above the
 * user row and the capsule grows upward, shrinking the Braindump.
 *
 * It is also where the app SPEAKS — but from a STRIP above the capsule, not
 * from inside it. That is a placement decision (notices are not part of the
 * dock), and it is worth being precise about what it did and did not fix: at the
 * resting state the omnibar never moved for a notice, on either structure, at
 * any viewport height down to 360px — the capsule's bottom is pinned by the
 * column, so a row grows it upward into the braindump. What DID jump was the
 * undo toast, measured off this capsule's top edge; it is a strip row now and
 * measures nothing.
 *
 * The conversation still shares an edge — you type into the pill, the app
 * answers one row above it — and a notice tray still grows upward out of its row
 * into the same airspace as the omnibar's suggestion panel, one occupant at a
 * time. See components/sidebar/dock-notices.tsx and
 * memory/plans/notices-in-place.md.

          Both children render null when they have nothing to say, so the resting
          column is unchanged.

          The notice rows are in FLOW, and at the resting state (chat closed)
          that costs nothing measurable — the capsule's bottom is pinned by the
          column and the braindump's flex-1 absorbs the row, at every viewport
          height down to 360px.

          The undo row is NOT in flow, and that difference is measured rather
          than reasoned. It appears and vanishes on a 5s timer the instant after
          the user acts, so it is the one row whose arrival lands under a moving
          cursor; and with chat expanded in a short window the column has no
          slack left to absorb it. `absolute bottom-full` takes it out of the
          squeeze budget entirely, at the cost of needing an opaque ground since
          it now overlays the braindump's last row. */}
