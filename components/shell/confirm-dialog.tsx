/**
 * The one confirm prompt for the whole app, driven by ui-store.confirm().
 * Mounted once in AppShell; replaces the per-feature AlertDialog copies.
 *
 * BEING SHARED IS WHY FOCUS NEEDS HANDLING HERE. Radix restores focus on close
 * by running `event.preventDefault(); trigger?.focus()` — correct for the
 * `<AlertDialogTrigger>` it was designed around, and a no-op for this dialog,
 * which has no trigger at all: the opener is any button anywhere that happens to
 * call `confirm()`. The preventDefault still lands, cancelling FocusScope's own
 * restore, so dismissing a confirm dropped the cursor on `<body>` and ended the
 * keyboard session — Tab resumed from the top of the document. It affected every
 * confirm in the app, and reading a delete prompt and deciding NOT to is the
 * ordinary case.
