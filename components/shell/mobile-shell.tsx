/**
 * The shell's height while a soft keyboard is up.
 *
 * `100dvh` is the LAYOUT viewport, which the keyboard does not shrink on iOS and
 * shrinks only under `interactive-widget=resizes-content` on Android — so a
 * bottom-docked input is the first thing the keyboard covers, and a shell that
 * cannot scroll has no way to bring it back. Clamping the column to the VISUAL
 * viewport lands the dock on top of the keyboard instead, for the omnibar and
 * the Beacon composer alike.
 *
 * The 120px floor is what separates a keyboard from a URL bar: Safari's chrome
 * costs the visual viewport ~60–90px whenever it is expanded, and reacting to
 * that would resize the shell every time the page is scrolled up.
 *
 * The occlusion is measured against `vv.height * vv.scale`, not `vv.height`:
 * pinch-zoom shrinks the visual viewport by the scale factor for a reason that
 * has nothing to do with anything covering it, and iOS Safari has ignored
 * `maximum-scale` for pinch since iOS 10 (app/layout.tsx asks anyway). Raw
 * heights made a 1.2× pinch read as a 133px keyboard and collapsed the whole
 * column — header, content and dock — into the top half of the screen, taking
 * DaySchedule's derived hour height down with it.

 * MOBILE_TAB_ORDER, Braindump · Today · Chat. Surfaces reuse the desktop
 * primitives (shared Braindump, DayBuckets/DayList via MobileViewRouter,
 * ChatConversation) rather than the old bespoke panels. Rendered under the
 * shell's single DndContext, so items stay draggable.
 *
 * Content sits directly on the paper backdrop. The rounded `bg-canvas` panel it
 * used to float in — the mobile echo of the desktop canvas — is gone; on paper
 * that near-identical fill bought a hairline and a shadow and nothing else, and
 * it was the third bordered surface on a screen the redesign cut to two. Its
 * layout duties (min-h-0 / flex-1 / overflow-hidden, so each view's own
 * full-height ScrollArea has something to be full-height OF) were already
 * duplicated by the keyed cross-fade box below, which now carries them alone.
