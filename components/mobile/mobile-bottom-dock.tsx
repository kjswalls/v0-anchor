/**
 * Mobile bottom dock — the desktop sidebar-dock recipe, at phone width: one
 * surface-3 well (radius 10, `--shadow-elev-bar`, inset 10px) holding a single
 * row — the 44px mode card, then a white pill — with the app's notice strip
 * ABOVE it rather than inside it. Owns the bottom safe area. NOT overflow-hidden
 * — the omnibar's results panel opens upward out of it.
 *
 * The pill is the omnibar everywhere except Beacon, where it is the chat
 * composer instead. One bar, one address for typing, whichever surface you are
 * on — which is the same argument that keeps the notice stack mounted here on
 * every tab.
 *
 * The soft radius-24 pill this replaces was the last surface still wearing the
 * old mobile chrome, and the three-tab bar under the omnibar went with it: the
 * mode card + its sheet (components/mobile/mode-switcher-sheet.tsx) are the way
 * between surfaces now, which is what let the well shrink from ~130px to 68px —
 * 88px counting this box's own 8px top gap and 12px bottom floor, and more only
 * where the safe-area inset exceeds that floor.
 *
 * The notice stack is capped at ONE row, the same as the desktop now that most
 * notices render on the thing they are about — anything past the first folds
 * into a "+N more" row that expands in place. See
 * memory/plans/notices-in-place.md.

          This is a placement change here, not a geometry fix — the phone never
          had the problem. This dock is the last child of a fixed-height flex
          column, so it grows upward and the well's bottom edge (and the omnibar
          in it) measured 0px of movement in every configuration, notices inside
          the well or above it. What the move buys is one shape across both
          shells: the app's rows read as the app's rows, on the dock rather than
          in it.

          Mounted on every tab, Beacon included. The point of one voice with one
          address is that going quiet on the tab where the user is talking to
          Beacon would put the two halves of the same conversation on different
          screens. */}
