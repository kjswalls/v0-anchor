/**
 * The dock's mode card and the sheet it opens — the replacement for the
 * three-tab bar that used to sit under the omnibar.
 *
 * Card and sheet ship together because they are one control: the card shows the
 * surface you are on and the sheet is how you leave it, and splitting them would
 * mean two components deriving the same `activeTab` and agreeing by luck.
 *
 * `[data-tour="tab-*"]` rides the sheet's ENTRIES. It used to be on the tab
 * bar's buttons, where it was also how two @mobile specs changed tab in one
 * click; those go through `switchMobileTab` in tests/e2e/helpers/app.ts now,
 * which opens the sheet first. The onboarding tour points at the card instead
 * (`data-tour="mode-card"`) — spotlighting an entry inside a closed sheet would
 * be a hole cut in the overlay around nothing.
 *
 * NO RELAY ON THE CARD. mobile-redesign.md § Motion names the card's tap as the
 * second place to earn the radial field, and the tap point genuinely is a good
 * origin for one — but the tap's own consequence is this sheet, which is fixed
 * to the bottom of the screen over a full-bleed `backdrop-blur-[7px]` scrim and
 * so covers the dock within a frame or two of the press. A burst plays out over
 * the best part of a second; behind frosted glass, none of it is seen. Moving it
 * to the sheet's CLOSE would clear the occlusion and lose the point: the origin
 * would no longer be the thing that was touched, just a flash on a card. The
 * capture strike in the bar beside this one is the placement that survives, and
 * the spec ranks it first for its own reasons.
