/**
 * The 18px cap row above a Schedule grid — the only place a grouped Schedule
 * says what its partition is.
 *
 * Two shapes for the two modes, one meaning. In LANES mode each cap sits over
 * its own band, so the caption is the lane's header. In FOCUS mode the caps are
 * a plain row of chips, because there is no x to hang them on — that is Week,
 * routine grouping, and any day whose group count is past the lane budget.
 *
 * Every cap is a toggle. Picking one recedes the other lanes; picking it again
 * clears. That is the whole of focus, and it is what makes the no-"Other"-lane
 * decision affordable: a group with no lane of its own is still one click from
 * having the entire grid to itself.

 * which namespace to ask. Routine and bucket groups have no colour and get no
 * bead rather than a grey one — an empty swatch reads as "colour missing", and
