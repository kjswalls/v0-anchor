/**
 * Row metadata primitives — the "quiet rail".
 *
 * The old boxed pills (border + fill + 11px label, one per datum) were replaced
 * because their widths were content-driven: sitting left-aligned inside
 * fixed-width columns they produced ragged right edges and unequal gaps, and
 * tasks and habits used different column sets so a mixed list never shared an
 * edge. The fix is de-chroming, not more columns — every datum becomes either a
 * fixed-size glyph or bare tabular text, so alignment comes from identical box
 * sizes rather than from lining up unlike content.
 *
 * Color is quarantined: it lives in a 6px dot, three 2px bars, a flame, or the
 * single lime bead marking today in the weekday run — never in a container and
 * never in body text. See components/primitives/task-row.tsx for how these
 * compose into the trailing rail, and which of them reserve width.

 * or a bare numeral — which is what buys the alignment, and what costs the reader
 * any label saying what they are looking at. This is where the label goes: an
 * eyebrow naming the COLUMN over the value spelled out in words.
 *
 * It wears `TooltipContent`, which deliberately wears the popover shell rather
 * than shadcn's inverted chip (see components/ui/tooltip.tsx), so a rail tooltip,
 * the DayDots keycap panel and the sidebar's History popover are one object.
 *

 * it renders in a system font at the OS's own delay, unstyleable, and having both

 * flickers, and at 10px it's easy to miss that it moved at all. Here the slot

 * so the readout reads as one value moving rather than as a stream of unrelated
 * ones.
 *
 * Takes the value and its formatter, not formatted text, for two reasons: the
 * direction has to be derived by comparing numbers, and "1h" appearing for both
 * 60 and 60-after-59 must be told apart from "1h" that hasn't changed.
 *
 * `active` is what makes the turn worth watching, and it is not decoration. A
 * resize expands the grid to the full day at a frozen scale, which drops the hour
 * height to ~29px and pins every block under ~78 minutes at PANE_MIN_H — so the
 * block barely changes size and this figure is the ENTIRE readout for the gesture.
 * At the rail's resting 10px muted grey it is missable, so for the duration of the

 * Off-days are a ring rather than a faded fill so presence is carried by SHAPE,

 * container.
 *
 * It went bare when the bucket card's 45px header band was deleted, on the
 * argument that a chip out-weighs the label it belongs to. That was right about
 * the old 20px chip and wrong about the chip as such: with the bucket caption
 * muted down to sit under the rows in the reading order, a bare numeral beside a
 * faint label stops reading as a count at all — it reads as part of the word.
 * The container is what separates them, so it comes back, sized to the caption
 * rather than to the band it used to live in.
 *
 * `--surface-3` deliberately, not a border: it is the app's well value, so the
 * chip is recessed in light and raised in dark. That polarity flip is the same
 * one every other surface-3 chip in the app already has (see DayKeycaps), and it
 * keeps the count reading as a slot the number sits in rather than as a control.
 *
 * `size` tracks the caption it sits in: 18px in the day view's 22px row, 16px in
 * week's 16px one, where a 20px chip could not fit at all. Both are min-widths —
 * a three-digit count grows sideways only, so the caption never reflows
 * vertically.
