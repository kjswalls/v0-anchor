 *   braindump — minimal metadata, tasks draggable
 *   bucket    — full pills + unschedule/skip controls, date-aware completion
 * Draggable id = item id per lib/dnd/CONTRACT.md; habits are not drag
 * sources (parity with the old timeline).
 *
 * TODO(debt): components/ai/morning-triage-list.tsx ships a THIRD row shape.
 * It couldn't reuse this one — it needs a date/age column this rail doesn't
 * have, a fixed 30px height (this row's py-1.5 + line-clamp-2 is taller, and
 * height is the entire point of that feature), no useDraggable (it renders in a
 * portal), and title-only click-to-edit (whole-row click competes with the
 * triage gesture). The convergence is a `context: 'triage'` variant here:
 * optional age column, single-line title, drag opt-out, click target on the
 * title. Owed, not done.

          column.

          Not inside: the title is `line-clamp`ed, which is `overflow: hidden`,
          so any title that filled its clamp hid the glyph entirely — and the
          week columns render compact one-line rows in narrow columns, which is
          exactly where titles overflow and where a week of checkpoints is most
          worth scanning. It also sat under the paragraph's `title` attribute on
          suppressed rows, firing a native tooltip on top of the Radix one that
          RailTooltip exists to replace.

          Not a rail column: the rail's five columns each reserve width on every
          row of both types, so a sixth would cost 20px on every row in the app
          to say something true of a handful of them.

          Muted ink, never honey — being a milestone is an identity, not a
          warning, and this is the row of a checkpoint that may well be late. On
          touch the tooltip never fires, so the glyphs are ones a reader can
          place unaided and the full attribution is one tap away in the edit
          sheet's Goal chip. The sr-only text is for the reader the tooltip
          never reaches at all. */}

      {/* Trailing metadata — the "quiet rail". Fixed order, innermost to the
          right edge: [occasional] → [days] → [identity] → [glyph] → [quantity].
          The last FOUR reserve width, and they do so on EVERY row of BOTH types,
          so a mixed task+habit list forms four straight vertical rails plus the
          row's own right edge:

            days     59px   weekday dots — empty slot when the item doesn't repeat
            identity 96px   tag dot + truncating name (6px, dot only, below lg)
            glyph    36px   priority bars / streak flame + count
            quantity 48px   duration, right-aligned tabular figures, both types

          Every one of these columns is a de-chromed glyph or a bare numeral, and
          none of them carries a label — which is what buys the alignment and what
          costs the reader any way of knowing what they are looking at. Each one
          therefore answers on hover, through RailTooltip (pills.tsx): an eyebrow
          naming the column over the value in words. The native `title` attributes
          these used to carry are gone; they fired a second, unstyleable tooltip
          in a system font at the OS's own delay.

          Reserving the first two is a change of mind, and the reason is that the
          old rule ("only fixed-size things reserve") produced rails only at the
          two outermost columns — the tag sized to its name, so its dot landed at
          a different x on every row and the column read as debris rather than as
          a column. Reserving costs a void on rows that lack the datum; a straight
          edge down a dense list is worth more than those pixels. It stays cheap
          because the two new slots only exist at lg and above, where the day view
          has the room; below that the day dots unmount and the tag collapses to
          its 6px dot.

          Genuinely occasional metadata (start time, habit progress) is still NOT
          reserved and now sits INBOARD of the day dots. Because the rail is
          right-anchored, a variable item only moves what is to its left — so
          parking them innermost lets the title's elastic gap absorb them while
          every column outboard of them stays nailed down.

          Action controls stay absolutely pinned to the left of the rail and only
          fade in on hover/focus, so they reserve no space and shift nothing. */}
