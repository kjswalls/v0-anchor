/**
 * The pause switch a gate group header (routine/program) carries — the Scope
 * Rail's switch, moved onto the section it governs.
 *
 * Flipping it off pauses the whole container, which takes its members off every
 * surface (locked decision 1), so the group empties itself. Turning a fully-off
 * scope back on happens from the Display menu's "Paused scopes" list, not here —
 * a paused scope has no visible members and so no header to host a switch.
 *
 * DISPLAY is resolved at today and shows the LOCAL (stored) state, never the
 * effective one: a routine whose own switch is on but that a program is holding
 * off still reads on, or resuming the program hands back a routine the user
 * believes they turned off. The WRITE lives in setGateOn, which re-resolves at
 * click time and is dateless — see its header for the date-following contract.
