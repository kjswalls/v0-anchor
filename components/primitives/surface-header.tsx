/**
 * The double-card header: a flat `surface-3` capsule framing a shadowed 37px
 * `surface-2` row-pill. Dims from Figma — gray 406×50 r10; pill 385×37 r10,
 * inset (10,6), shadow `--shadow-elev-sm`; title Inter Medium 13.
 *
 * Extracted because the mobile redesign gave it a second home rather than a
 * second copy. On desktop it heads the sidebar's Braindump; on a phone the two
 * DATELESS tabs (Braindump, Beacon) wear it INSTEAD of the dated header card —
 * a calendar above a surface with no date was the thing the one-card header set
 * out to remove, so it must not come back as a second header stacked on this.
