/**
 * Whose local state the seed below is.

 * it finds NOTHING, because an unstamped browser holding state is a browser
 * where nothing on disk records who wrote it, and that is exactly the shared-
 * machine case the stamp exists for.
 *
 * WITHOUT this, the fixture is self-contradictory: `seededViewState()` puts one
 * account's view prefs on disk and `sessionCookies()` signs that same account
 * in, but nothing on disk says the two belong together — so the app treats a
 * legitimately-seeded browser as an orphaned one and clears what it can before
 * the first assertion runs.
 *
 * SEEDED HERE RATHER THAN PER-SPEC, deliberately. This fixture's job is to
 * present the browser of a user who has signed in on this machine before, and
 * as of lib/local-state.ts that state includes the stamp exactly as much as it
 * includes the auth cookie. An unstamped browser is a real state, but it is the
 * one-time transitional one — the first load after the feature ships — not the
 * steady state 119 specs should each be re-establishing by hand. Seeding it
 * beside the view prefs also keeps the two in step: a spec that seeded prefs and
 * forgot the stamp would silently get them half-cleared, which is precisely the
 * N-copies-to-keep-in-step problem the feature under test was written to end.
