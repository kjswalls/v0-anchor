/**
 * Drive a dnd-kit pointer drag.
 *
 * The previous version of this helper was wrong in four ways that each produced
 * a confusing failure rather than an honest one:
 *
 * 1. It called `target.scrollIntoViewIfNeeded()` AFTER `mouse.down()` with no
 *    try/finally. Most drop targets in this app only MOUNT while a drag is
 *    active, so when that call timed out the error escaped with the pointer still
 *    pressed — corrupting every later action in the test and reporting a
 *    scrollIntoViewIfNeeded timeout that hid the real cause.
 * 2. It aimed the CURSOR at the target's centre. The app uses `closestCenter`
 *    (components/shell/app-shell.tsx), which compares the DRAGGED element's rect
 *    centre — not the pointer — against each droppable's centre. Grabbing a row
 *    by its title put the row's centre ~120px right of the cursor because of the
 *    reserved metadata rail, so the aim was systematically off.
 * 3. It measured the source before pressing and never re-measured, even though
 *    activating a drag mounts a drop zone in every bucket and reflows the canvas.
 * 4. It slept `waitForTimeout(150)` and hoped, instead of waiting for the drop
 *    target to actually report itself as hovered.
 *
 * It also documented an 8px activation threshold; the sensor uses 5.
 *
 * This version presses at a known point, aims by the dragged rect rather than the
 * cursor, homes in on the target's own `data-dnd-over` signal, and always releases.
 *
 * KNOWN LIMIT — prefer an ADJACENT drop target. A drag that must cross a scroll
 * boundary (morning → evening, where evening starts below the fold) triggers
 * dnd-kit's autoscroll, and autoscroll makes the collision model genuinely
 * non-deterministic to drive: dnd-kit collides droppable rects measured at drag
 * start against a scroll-compensated active rect, so its answer depends on how
 * much scrolling happened to accumulate mid-gesture. The loop below converges most
 * of the time but not reliably enough to gate CI on. Test bucket reassignment
 * against a NEIGHBOURING bucket — identical store action, identical observable —
 * and cover long-distance moves through the schedule sheet, which issues the same
 * commands without a gesture.
