/**
 * GOALS — the aspire container (memory/plans/long-term-goals.md).
 *
 * What is worth an end-to-end run rather than a unit test is everything that
 * crosses the store/DB/render boundary, which is exactly where this feature's
 * two shipped blockers lived and where the unit suite could not see them:
 *
 *   1. **A goal's surfaces actually respond.** The `/goal/[id]` Organize button
 *      shipped INERT — it armed a dialog mounted only in AppShell, which that
 *      route does not render — and 1375 green unit tests said nothing, because
 *      nothing about it is a pure function. One assertion here is the whole
 *      cost of never shipping that class of bug again.
 *   2. **An inline-created milestone is FINDABLE.** It shipped bucketed, which
 *      removed it from the braindump (the only list undated work lives in) and
 *      added it to no day column, so it existed on no planner surface at all.
 *      The store test asserted the field; only a rendered surface asserts the
 *      consequence.
 *   3. **A role survives the round trip as a ROLE.** The arrays are an app-side
 *      view of one join table, and every path that flattens them — a bin
 *      snapshot, a partial patch — silently turns milestones into plain
 *      members. Reading `goal_items` back is the only proof.
 *
 * Serial, and under its OWN prefix. Every test writes rows on the shared test
 * user, and sweeping the bare TEST_TITLE_PREFIX from two files hard-DELETEs the
 * other's fixtures mid-test under `fullyParallel` with 4 workers — the lesson
 * programs.spec.ts had to learn once.
