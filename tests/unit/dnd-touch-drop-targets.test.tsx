/**
 * The one drop target a finger is not offered, and what it gets instead
 * (lib/dnd/CONTRACT.md § Not every target is offered to every input).
 *
 * `scheduled:{bucket}:{before|after}:{ref}` is an 8px sliver between two timed
 * rows — a third of WCAG 2.5.8's 24px minimum target size, on the input with
 * the coarsest pointer. Mechanically it is a MOVE like every other drop
 * (`inferDropTime` resolves it as ±30 min from the reference row's own time), so
 * it is not the drag-to-reorder `dnd-no-reorder.test.ts` forbids and it survived
 * that sweep. Kirby then removed it for touch anyway, with the cost accepted: on
 * a phone there is no "put this just before that one" — you drop the row in the
 * bucket and set a time.
 *
 * It is a SUBSTITUTION, not a deletion. The same box mounts for a finger
 * carrying `spine:{bucket}:{above|below}:{id}`, which assigns the bucket with no
 * time. Deleting it outright moves where drops LAND — `closestCenter` compares
 * centres, so the bottom of a tall card starts resolving to the next bucket.
 * That is `dnd-touch-drop-geometry.test.tsx`'s subject; this file is about which
 * target is offered and what each one means.
 *
 * ## What has to be true, and why each half needs its own test
 *
 * 1. The rule exists once (`OFFERED_TO`, lib/dnd/drop-targets.ts), and exactly
 *    one of the pair is offered to any given input.
 * 2. The VIEW mounts the right one of the two. This is the view-level rule:
 *    what should this user be OFFERED? Only the view knows what it renders, so
 *    only a mount test can see it.
 * 3. `resolveDrop` answers the grammar-level question — what does this id MEAN
 *    for this input? — over every id shape, for every view that will ever emit
 *    one. Not a backstop for (2): a different question, at a different level.
 * 4. The SHELL actually feeds the real input type in. Without this one, a shell
 *    hard-coding `'pointer'` leaves 1–3 green and ships the sliver to phones —
 *    the exact "load-bearing claim no test held" this repo keeps getting burned
 *    by. Hence `beginDrag` is imported from app-shell rather than rebuilt.
 * 5. Nothing else moved: every OTHER target in the grammar still resolves
 *    identically for a finger and for a cursor.
