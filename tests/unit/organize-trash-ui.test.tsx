/**
 * The Trash SECTION — the console's one heterogeneous list, and its one
 * per-row action.
 *
 * What is worth pinning here rather than in the store tests:
 *
 *  - The KIND is on the row as a word. Every other section is homogeneous, so
 *    its column header names the kind for every row at once; this one is not,
 *    and a name-hashed CategoryIcon encodes no kind whatsoever. A trashed task
 *    and a trashed project both called "Reading" would otherwise be
 *    pixel-identical, and ⌘Z after restoring the wrong one is not a recovery.
 *  - A FAILED fetch says so. Rendering an empty list would tell someone hunting
 *    for a deleted routine that it is gone for good — the one wrong answer this
 *    surface can give.
 *  - The Restore control is a real button, always visible, and carries
 *    `data-organize-row` so the filter's ↓ still lands somewhere useful.
