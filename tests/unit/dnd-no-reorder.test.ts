/**
 * Drag never reorders — which is why "no row reorder on mobile" needs no
 * mobile branch.
 *
 * ## The decision this pins
 *
 * Kirby: "I don't think we need to be able to drag Rows on mobile." Read as
 * REORDER — the reading the ticket carried — the removal turned out to be a
 * removal of nothing:
 * Anchor has no drag-to-reorder on any platform. `planner-store.reorderTasks`
 * exists and has zero call sites; `@dnd-kit/sortable` is in package.json and is
 * imported nowhere; the only reorder UI in the product is the Organize console's
 * up/down buttons (`components/planner/organize/member-list.tsx`), which are
 * buttons on purpose and already work with a thumb.
 *
 * Every drop the grammar in lib/dnd/CONTRACT.md can resolve is a MOVE: it
 * assigns a bucket, a day, a time, a project block, or unschedules. None of them
 * writes `items.order`. So the property "a finger cannot initiate a reorder" is
 * currently true for the strongest possible reason — there is no reorder in the
 * drag path for any input type to reach — and gating it on `isMobile` would be a
 * branch guarding a thing that does not exist.
 *
 * ## Why a test rather than a code change
 *
 * Because the property is free today and would stop being free silently.
 * `lib/sort-rows.ts` already names the follow-up ("Wire drag-to-reorder into the
 * untimed section…"), and `orderable: true` on the task type is standing
 * permission to do it. The day someone does, touch inherits it by default —
 * dnd-kit sensors do not distinguish drop targets — and Kirby's decision is
 * reversed without anyone deciding to reverse it. These two checks are the
 * tripwire on that, and they are what "capability-shaped" can mean when the
 * capability's answer is currently "nobody has this".
 *
 * Deliberately NOT blocked: a reorder driven by BUTTONS. That is the pattern the
 * Organize console already uses, it is the WCAG 2.5.7 single-pointer
 * alternative, and it is the shape a mobile reorder should take if one is ever
 * wanted. The second check below scopes itself to files that import dnd-kit for
 * exactly that reason.
 */

/**
 * Move or reorder, declared once per command kind.
 *
 * A `Record` keyed by the union, so this is a COMPILE-time exhaustiveness check
 * as much as a runtime one: adding a variant to `DropCommand` without answering
 * this question fails `tsc`, and answering `'reorder'` fails the assertion
 * below. That is the single place the rule lives — the alternative (an
 * `isMobile &&` at each of the six droppable definition sites) is the scattering
 * this repo's registry convention exists to avoid.
