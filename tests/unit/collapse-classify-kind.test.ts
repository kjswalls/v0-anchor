/**
 * ONE CLASSIFY KIND — migration 039.
 *
 * `project` and `group` were the same shape wearing two names, and tasks and
 * habits have been one entity since 019, so a second classify kind was a
 * distinction the data model no longer made. This file pins the three things
 * that the collapse could break silently, which is to say the three that a
 * green suite would otherwise not notice:
 *
 *   1. THE PINNED LEGACY PROJECTION. `habits[]` must keep emitting `group`, and
 *      `habitGroups[]` must keep being a required array of the four container
 *      fields. The OpenClaw plugin `safeParse`s the whole context response and
 *      THROWS on drift — one wrong key does not degrade a field, it bricks the
 *      plugin's entire cached context on its next fetch. Every other test in the
 *      repo works with the ITEM shape, so nothing else would have caught it.
 *
 *   2. ONE CONTAINER PER ITEM. The role survived the kind: an item still answers
 *      the CLASSIFY axis with exactly one value, on exactly one field.
 *
 *   3. THE MIGRATION IS RE-RUNNABLE, and leaves the ballast alone. Asserted
 *      against the SQL text, which is a weaker instrument than a database and
 *      is said so out loud below — but the specific clauses it names are the
 *      ones whose deletion turns a re-run from a no-op into a data loss.
