/**
 * Where a drop LANDS once the timed slivers stop being offered to a finger.
 *
 * ## The bug this exists to prevent
 *
 * `closestCenter` compares CENTRES, not containment — `tests/e2e/helpers/dnd.ts`
 * says so, and `centerOfRectangle` in dnd-kit's source is the whole of it. So
 * the set of droppables a card mounts decides which regions of that card belong
 * to it at all. The 8px gap boxes between timed rows are what give a bucket's
 * timed spine a centre every ~44px; the card's other droppables (the bare
 * bucket, the untimed section) have centres at or above the card's middle.
 *
 * Withhold the gap boxes from touch and mount NOTHING in their place, and the
 * lowest centre a tall Morning card owns is its own midpoint. Everything below
 * the midpoint between that and Afternoon's centre then resolves to AFTERNOON —
 * a silent wrong-bucket write, in the view whose entire job is bucket placement.
 * The band opens once the dragged-over card is taller than the next card plus
 * two gaps (about four timed rows) and grows without bound after that.
 *
 * That is why the touch rule in lib/dnd/drop-targets.ts is a SUBSTITUTION: the
 * same box mounts, carrying `spine:{bucket}:{above|below}:{id}` instead of
 * `scheduled:{bucket}:{before|after}:{ref}`. Same rect, same centre, different
 * command — "assign this bucket, no time" instead of "schedule at that row's
 * time ±30 min".
 *
 * ## What is real here and what is modelled
 *
 * REAL: the rendered `DayBuckets`, so the set of droppable ids under test is
 * the one the view actually mounts for each input; dnd-kit's own
 * `closestCenter`; and `resolveDrop`, so the assertion is about the COMMAND, not
 * about an id.
 *
 * MODELLED: the rects. jsdom has no layout — every `getBoundingClientRect` is
 * zeroes — so heights come from the table below and boxes are stacked in
 * document order. The numbers are ordinary (44px rows, 8px gaps, 16px card
 * gaps); nothing in the conclusion depends on their exact values, because the
 * third test re-runs the same model with the spine ids removed and shows the
 * band appear. A model that could not produce the bug could not pin the fix.
