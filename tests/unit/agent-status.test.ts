/**
 * What a delegated item says on a row.
 *
 * The elapsed reading is the reason this exists: "Working" is not information,
 * "Working 3h" is — an agent four minutes into a task is fine, and the same
 * agent three hours in has died somewhere that nobody would otherwise notice
 * until they opened the item.
 *
 * Which makes the WRONG number the thing to guard against hardest. That is why
 * the stamp is a dedicated `aiStatusAt` (migration 038) rather than the item's
 * trigger-maintained `updated_at`: the latter moves on any edit, so renaming a
 * task mid-run would silently reset the clock. No number beats a wrong one, and
 * these tests pin the cases where the honest answer is "say nothing".
