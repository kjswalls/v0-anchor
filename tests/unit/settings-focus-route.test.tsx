/**
 * /settings/[[...pane]] — the two effects that argue about the URL.
 *
 * Nothing under tests/ imported this route before, which is how a ?focus= that
 * silently does nothing shipped. The self-routing claim is "the id is enough,
 * the pane no longer has to be right", and it has exactly one hard case: a
 * record whose home pane IS the fallback. The focus effect skips it (home ===
 * pane), so the normalising replace is the only navigation that link ever gets
 * — and that replace carried no query, so the param was dropped before anything
 * could read it. On a cold load the hydration gate means SettingsShell is not
 * even mounted yet, so "before anything could read it" is every time.
 *
 * These render the page UNHYDRATED on purpose: that is the state a deep link
 * arrives in, and both effects run above the gate's early return.
