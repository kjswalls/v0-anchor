/**
 * The settings route's gate, pinned.
 *
 * This is the guarantee the route exists to keep: the stores it reads are
 * localStorage-persisted under browser-GLOBAL keys, so on a shared browser
 * they hold the last person to sign in until Supabase answers for the current
 * one. Rendering them as live controls in that window lets a click write
 * someone else's preference into this user's row.
 *
 * The gate was relaxed for speed — it no longer waits on planner-store's
 * seven-table item load, which this route reads nothing from — and these are
 * the cases that say the relaxation did not cost the guarantee. Note there is
 * no `isLoading` parameter to pass: the only way this can answer "yes" is a
 * settings response stamped for the account currently signed in.
