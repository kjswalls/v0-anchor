/**
 * The undo row, and what the container rollback must not do to it.
 *
 * The surface is a strip above the dock now rather than a sonner toast
 * (components/notices/undo-strip.tsx), so these assertions read the store the
 * hook writes instead of a mocked toast() call. The claims are unchanged — they
 * were never about sonner.
 *
 * `useUndoToast` decides "is this new?" by comparing `actionLog[0].id` against
 * the last one it saw. That is a perfectly good test for the append-only log it
 * was written against — every entry arrives at the front and stays there.
 *
 * `undoFailedCreate` is the first thing in the app that reaches backwards into
 * an already-published log. Its FIRST design popped the failed create's entry
 * off the stack, which changes what `actionLog[0]` IS: the previous entry slides
 * back into the front, its id does not match the ref, and the hook reads that as
 * a brand-new action. The user sees the toast for something they did a minute
 * ago pop up a second time, unprompted, with an Undo button now wired to a
 * different step of the stack than the sentence above it names.
 *
 * `ced2230` replaced the pop with a relabel precisely because reaching backwards
 * is hostile to readers like this one — but the reason it is safe is a property
 * of the log (ids stable, length never shrinks), not of the rollback, and
 * nothing was holding that property in place. These tests hold it.
