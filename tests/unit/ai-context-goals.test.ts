/**
 * Beacon's account of what the work is FOR (plan Phase 4).
 *
 * The plan names this file's absence as a gate: without a goals fixture the
 * byte-pinned context tests verify the section only by never reaching it, which
 * is a true but empty check. Two things are load-bearing here — the section
 * must stay OFF for every input that had it off before, and when it is on it
 * must not recommend the exact item the Paused section forbids three lines
 * later.
