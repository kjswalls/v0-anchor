/**
 * The trashed-name refusal, ON THE NEW CREATE FORM.
 *
 * `projects_user_id_name_key` is a plain unique index with no
 * `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`, so a deleted project keeps its name reserved for
 * the full 30 days while being invisible to the store. Typing that name used to
 * produce a project that opened, took a colour and a time block, and evaporated
 * on the next reload — the insert 23505'd into a `.catch(console.error)` after
 * the optimistic `set()`.
 *
 * `useTrashedNames` + `heldByTrash` close that, and an e2e test has guarded it
 * on the OLD bottom-of-list draft row. This branch moved creation into the third
 * pane (CreateForm), and the guard came with it as a `validate` prop — a prop is
 * easy to drop in a move, and dropping it is SILENT: the form still creates, it
 * just stops refusing. Nothing in the unit suite covered `project-new-problem`,
 * only `type-new-problem`, whose rules are synchronous and local.
 *
 * So this pins the async half: the sentence has to survive a fetch that resolves
 * AFTER the form is already on screen, which is the real order of events.
