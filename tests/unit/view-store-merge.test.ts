/**
 * The rehydration gap the e2e suite structurally cannot cover.
 *
 * zustand's persist `merge` defaults to a SHALLOW `{...current, ...persisted}`,
 * so a nested object is replaced wholesale rather than merged. A stored
 * `anchor-view` blob predates `containers`, so without a custom merge every
 * existing install reads `filters.containers` as `undefined` and `.length`
 * throws on the first render — a white screen, not a degraded filter.
 *
 * tests/e2e/helpers/session.ts seeds a blob that OMITS both filter objects, so
 * every spec rehydrates fresh defaults and stays green while a real browser
 * breaks. That is why these are unit tests against `normalizeFilters` — the
 * function the store's `merge` runs both filter objects through — rather than
 * an e2e assertion. Do not delete them on the grounds that "e2e covers this".
 */

/**
 * The store's own `merge`, exercised through a real rehydrate.
 *
 * The tests below this block cover `normalizeFilters` in isolation, which is
 * necessary but NOT sufficient: delete the whole `merge:` block from
 * view-store's persist config and every one of them still passes, because none
 * of them touches the store. So does the e2e suite — its seeded blob omits both
 * filter objects and takes the trivial branch.
 *
 * These seed the blob a real pre-Phase-0 browser holds and drive
 * `persist.rehydrate()`. Both filter objects are asserted deliberately: a
 * half-wired merge that normalizes `canvasFilters` and passes
 * `braindumpFilters` through raw type-checks fine (the payload is cast to
 * Record<string, unknown>), leaves the suite green, and still white-screens the
 * sidebar.
