/**
 * The drag grip inside a project block must not opt out of touch scrolling.
 *
 * `touch-action: none` is settled BEFORE any sensor sees the gesture: it tells
 * the browser not to pan, so it applies whichever sensor eventually claims the
 * touch. On a grip that means a finger landing there can neither scroll the
 * list nor — for the TouchSensor's first 250ms — drag anything. It is a dead
 * 16px column down the left of every row in the block.
 *
 * The grip is `opacity-0` until hover, which is why this survived the first pass
 * at the scroll bug: it looks like desktop-only chrome. It is not. It occupies
 * layout and hit-tests at full size regardless, and project blocks render on
 * phones through DayBuckets, the default mobile layout
 * (`components/mobile/mobile-view-router.tsx`).
 *
 * The class assertion is the whole test on purpose. jsdom computes no
 * `touch-action` and dispatches no scroll, so there is nothing behavioural to
 * observe — but the failure mode here is a single word in a className, which is
 * exactly what a string assertion catches. Same rule, same reason, in
 * `components/primitives/task-row.tsx`.
