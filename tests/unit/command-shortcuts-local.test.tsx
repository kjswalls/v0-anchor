/**
 * The bare-key claim (memory/plans/organize-console.md, Phase 1).
 *
 * `hooks/use-command-shortcuts.ts` is the app's ONE window keydown dispatcher and
 * its only guard was `isFocusedOnInput()` — input / textarea / select /
 * contentEditable. That is the right guard for a text field and the wrong one for
 * a surface built out of <button>s.
 *
 * The Organize console's list rows are buttons, so by that test a focused row is
 * "not typing" and every single-letter global still fires from it: `n` opens the
 * add dialog and REPLACES the console in the single ActiveDialog slot, `v`
 * switches the planner view behind the plate, `?` opens the shortcuts modal, and
 * `backspace` matches `delete_hovered`, which preventDefaults before any local
 * handler runs while lib/hovered-item.ts may still be pointing at a task on the
 * canvas. Typing a routine's name would destroy the surface being typed into.
 *
 * Any surface can now opt out by carrying `data-keys-local="true"` on its root.
 * What must stay true in BOTH directions: bare keys are withheld while a claim is
 * mounted, and mod-combos are NOT — trapping ⌘K or ⌘Z behind a local surface
 * would be a worse bug than the one being fixed.
