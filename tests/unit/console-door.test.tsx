/**
 * Organize doors on a route that mounts no console.
 *
 * `OrganizeConsole` is mounted once, in AppShell, and /item/[id] deliberately
 * does not render AppShell — so an Organize door there used to arm a dialog slot
 * nothing on the page reads. Because ui-store is a module singleton the armed
 * slot then SURVIVED the trip home and sprang the console open unasked, which is
 * strictly worse than a dead control. /goal/[id] and /settings each hit this and
 * each answered it privately; lib/console-door.ts is that answer stated once.
 *
 * These drive the real ItemDialog. The pair that matters is the same press in
 * two trees: with a console mounted beside it the press must NOT navigate,
 * without one it must — and in both the slot has to end up armed at the
 * section the door named.
