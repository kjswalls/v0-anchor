/**
 * WHERE THE CURSOR GOES WHEN A CONFIRM IS DISMISSED.
 *
 * `ConfirmDialog` is mounted once in AppShell and driven by `ui-store.confirm()`
 * — which is what makes it shared, and also what makes it structurally
 * different from every AlertDialog Radix was designed around. There is no
 * `AlertDialogTrigger` anywhere: the caller is a button somewhere else entirely
 * that happens to call a store action.
 *
 * Radix's modal content closes with
 *
 *     onCloseAutoFocus: (event) => { event.preventDefault(); trigger?.focus() }
 *
 * and that `preventDefault` cancels FocusScope's own restore. With a trigger
 * that trade is right. With NO trigger the optional call is a no-op, the
 * default restore has already been cancelled, and focus lands on `<body>` — so
 * dismissing a delete confirm silently ends the keyboard session. Tab starts
 * again from the top of the document, which inside a modal console means
 * nowhere near the row you were on.
 *
 * The console makes this sharp because it is the surface people drive from the
 * keyboard: `/` to filter, ↓ to a row, ↵ to open it. Reading the confirm and
 * deciding NOT to delete is the ordinary outcome, and it is the one that used to
 * cost the user their place.

     * in the same place — measured, not assumed.
     *
     * What is worth holding here: the focus machinery does not break the
     * destructive path, the write still lands, and nothing is left pointing at
     * the detached button. The mechanism itself is carried by the two tests
     * above, which both go red when the handler is removed.
