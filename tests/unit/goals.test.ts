 * roles the caller named (so a partial patch does not empty the roles it never
 * mentioned). The second is the one that bites — `syncContainers` patches only
 * the fields that differ and swallows rejections with `.catch(console.error)`,
 * so a reconcile that demanded all three arrays would make membership undo a
 * silent no-op.
 *
 * Enough of PostgREST to answer honestly, including the projection rule: a mock
 * that hands back whole rows lets a function look correct while reading a
 * column its own query never asked for — which is exactly the bug this fix
 * repaired (the reconcile used to `select('item_id')` and then need a role it
 * had not fetched).
