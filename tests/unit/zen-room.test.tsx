/**
 * The room, rendered.
 *
 * lib/zen.ts covers the ordering and the hero pick as pure functions; what
 * cannot be tested there is the one thing most likely to be got wrong twice —
 * WHICH DAY a tick lands on. Zen always shows today while the rest of the app
 * follows the navigable `selectedDate`, and the store's completion actions
 * default to `selectedDate` when handed no date. So a tick in here that forgot
 * to name today would silently mark a day the user is not looking at, on a
 * surface whose whole claim is that it shows now.
 *
 * These drive the real component against the real stores, with `selectedDate`
 * parked on a different day on purpose.
