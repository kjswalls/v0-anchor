/**
 * Filtering and grouping by GOAL — the aspire axis on a display surface.
 *
 * A goal is the third container role: many-to-many like a gate, but it switches
 * nothing off. Both halves of that are load-bearing here and neither is
 * self-evident from the code shape, so they are pinned:
 *
 *   MANY-TO-MANY means the axis is not a partition. An item may serve three
 *   goals, so the FILTER unions them and the GROUPING claims each row once —
 *   `lib/grouping.ts`'s documented first-claim-wins rule, borrowed verbatim
 *   from routines rather than invented here.
 *
 *   NO SUPPRESSION means every path that decides whether an item is ACTIVE
 *   stays goal-blind. A filter narrows what you are looking at and clears with
 *   one click; `inactiveItemIdsOn` is DB state that outlives the session. The
 *   cases below check that the second never learns about the first.
 *
 * The ROLE on the membership is in scope too: all three roles filter and group
 * as members, because a role says what an item does FOR the goal, not whether
 * it serves it.
