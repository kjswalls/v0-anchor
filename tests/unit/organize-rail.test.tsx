/**
 * RISK SPIKE for the Organize console's rail (memory/plans/organize-console.md,
 * Phase 1). Everything in Phase 2 rides on the answer.
 *
 * The console replaces a horizontal tab strip with a GROUPED VERTICAL RAIL —
 * uppercase eyebrows ("CONTAINERS", "LABELS") and a hairline above Trash, sitting
 * as siblings of the tabs INSIDE the TabsList. That is a structural change to a
 * `role="tablist"`, and two things have to survive it:
 *
 *   1. `getByRole('tab', { name: 'Programs' })` must keep resolving. The e2e suite
 *      drives the manager that way (programs.spec.ts) and
 *      Phase 2's acceptance criterion is that that spec runs UNCHANGED.
 *
 *   2. Radix's RovingFocusGroup must step OVER the non-tab children rather than
 *      landing on them, or ↓ from the last tab in a group walks onto an eyebrow.
 *
 * Both are bought with `role="presentation"` on the wrappers. This pins that,
 * because if it were false the whole rail design would have to fall back to a
 * tablist of bare tabs with the grouping drawn outside it — a different component.
 *
 * jsdom + testing-library is a proxy for the DOM SHAPE, not for Playwright's own
 * accessible-name computation; the e2e specs remain the real gate. But if the
 * shape is wrong here it is wrong there too, and this runs in milliseconds.
