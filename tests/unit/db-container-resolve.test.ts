/**
 * Server-side container-id resolution (migration 027).
 *
 * THE AGENT PATH HAS NO STORE. planner-store's projectIdFor resolves
 * every client write against containers already in memory, but
 * /api/agent/tasks and /api/agent/habits never touch Zustand — and both create
 * schemas deliberately `.omit()` the id, because an agent holds no id↔name map.
 * So lib/db.ts has to do the lookup, or an agent-named container yields a row
 * with the name and a NULL id: invisible to the id-keyed rename fan-out, which
 * is the exact orphaning Phase 0 exists to remove.
 *
 * The UPDATE half matters more than the create half, and is the reason this is
 * a bug rather than an omission: leaving a stale id behind is WORSE than the
 * pre-027 behaviour, because the fan-out treats the id as truth and would drag
 * the item back into the container it was moved out of.
