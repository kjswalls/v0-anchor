/**
 * Phase 4 of the mobile redesign: the one place the radial relay is struck on a
 * phone, and the two surfaces that stopped naming a colour they could not know.
 *
 * The relay is a canvas, so none of what it draws is assertable here. What IS
 * assertable — and what a later change would break silently — is everything
 * around the draw: that the field is mounted in the PILL rather than as the
 * desktop halo, that it rests dark and is lit by one event only, that the event
 * is an item actually filing itself, that the window shuts again, and that the
 * whole thing is absent when the user has asked for reduced motion. RelayField
 * is stubbed to a div carrying its props so all five are readable.
 *
 * The desktop assertions in here are the load-bearing ones: Omnibar is the
 * sidebar dock's bar as well as the phone's, and `captureRelay` defaulting the
 * wrong way would put new motion on a surface the spec deliberately left alone.
