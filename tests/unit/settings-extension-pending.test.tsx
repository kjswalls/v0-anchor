/**
 * An extension row must not draw a control until its own store can answer for
 * it.
 *
 * The extensions store is fetched beside hydrateSettings, not inside it, so it
 * races the gate the settings page opens on. Inside that window `isEnabled()`
 * answers with the MANIFEST DEFAULT — which is not "off", it is "not known yet"
 * — and `configs` is empty. A toggle drawn from that reads as off for an
 * extension the server has on, and one click writes that off into the user's
 * row: for Beeminder, silently taking a live stakes integration down. A config
 * field drawn from it is worse in the other direction — the store's
 * whole-object write guard drops the keystroke with nothing but a console line.
 *
 * The window used to be unreachable by accident (the page waited on
 * planner-store's seven-table load, which the extensions fetch always beat).
 * It is reachable now, so the row states its own readiness.
