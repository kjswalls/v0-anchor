/**
 * The RESTING copy of the two omnibar shells.
 *
 * One component renders both (components/sidebar/omnibar.tsx, `variant`), and
 * the placeholder is the only thing on screen saying what the bar can do before
 * anyone touches it — the hint row and the results panel are both behind focus.
 * So the resting string is a contract, not decoration, and it is the kind of
 * thing a later edit "tidies" without noticing it collapsed the two shells into
 * one voice.
 *
 * Three things are pinned here:
 *   • the dock advertises more than adding (its old line named only the add),
 *   • the launcher still leads with search and still spells out commands,
 *   • the two are not the same string — the split between a resting capture bar
 *     and a summoned command surface is deliberate.
 *
 * Both shells are asserted through `data-omnibar-variant`, the same handle the
 * e2e helpers use, because both mount the same testid.
